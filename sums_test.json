Short-rate (long-rate) shocks refer to surprises in the three-month overnight index swap (OIS) rate (ten-year Bund yield).

A key lesson from the literature is that, in these circumstances, monetary, fiscal and structural policies are needed to jump-start and reflate the economy.[5]  The failure of inflation to accelerate more forcefully in the euro area over the past decade may, in fact, be less of a conundrum when considering the response of public spending to even sizeable changes in interest rates: before the pandemic hit the euro area, the primary balance was positive and growing in the years after 2014 (see left chart slide 7).

First, as a result of continued global uncertainties and their impact on confidence, our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections were revised down.

This lower bound, in turn, makes the conduct of monetary policy more challenging when inflation is below target. Accordingly, the greater impact on interest rates at those maturities that the negative rate policy has gives the central bank a powerful instrument to enhance transmission to the loan market.

While our analysis suggests that low inflation has, to a large extent, resulted from an unfavourable, one-sided distribution of shocks (as explained below), we judged that there was a risk that our previous inflation aim might further entrench expectations of low inflation (right chart, slide 5). We also clarified that this may imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above 2%.

First, as a result of continued global uncertainties and their impact on confidence, our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections were revised down. At the same time, indexing the TLTRO III rates to the main refinancing operations rate and the deposit facility rate implies that, should the ECB adjust these key interest rates, the average funding conditions under the programme would be correspondingly adjusted for banks, thus helping to align this programme with the broader monetary policy stance. The Governing Council decided to eliminate the 10 basis point spread over the key policy rates entailed in the initial pricing of the operations.

Finally, the revisions to the TLTRO III programme have also played a central role in easing bank funding conditions in a manner that protects the supply of credit to firms and households. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.[2]  Looking beyond the pandemic period, the future orientation of macroeconomic policies will need to meet several challenges.

First, as a result of continued global uncertainties and their impact on confidence, our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections were revised down. At the same time, indexing the TLTRO III rates to the main refinancing operations rate and the deposit facility rate implies that, should the ECB adjust these key interest rates, the average funding conditions under the programme would be correspondingly adjusted for banks, thus helping to align this programme with the broader monetary policy stance. The Governing Council decided to eliminate the 10 basis point spread over the key policy rates entailed in the initial pricing of the operations.

First, as a result of continued global uncertainties and their impact on confidence, our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections were revised down.

The Governing Council decided to eliminate the 10 basis point spread over the key policy rates entailed in the initial pricing of the operations.

Recall that at the end of 2019, with unemployment at a multidecade low and after the addition of almost 1-1/2 million workers to the labor force during the previous year, PCE inflation was 1.6 percent for the year.

In the case of the Federal Reserve, the FOMC chose a one-year memory for the inflation threshold that must be met before liftoff is considered, but it also indicated in September that the Committee expects to delay liftoff until inflation is \"on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\" Another factor I will consider in calibrating the pace of policy normalization post-liftoff is the average rate of PCE inflation since the new framework was adopted in August 2020\u2014a time, as it happened, that the federal funds rate was constrained at the ELB. Such a reference rule, which becomes relevant once the conditions for policy normalization have been met, is similar to the forward-looking Taylor-type rule for optimal monetary policy derived in Clarida, Gal\u00ed, and Gertler (1999)."], "FED": ["The euro area financial sector in the pandemic crisis   Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 23rd EURO FINANCE WEEK  Frankfurt am Main, 16 November 2020 [updated on 16 November 2020 at 10:50 CET] I am honoured to open the 23rd Euro Finance Week.

First, as a result of continued global uncertainties and their impact on confidence, our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections were revised down. At the same time, indexing the TLTRO III rates to the main refinancing operations rate and the deposit facility rate implies that, should the ECB adjust these key interest rates, the average funding conditions under the programme would be correspondingly adjusted for banks, thus helping to align this programme with the broader monetary policy stance. The Governing Council decided to eliminate the 10 basis point spread over the key policy rates entailed in the initial pricing of the operations.

First, as a result of continued global uncertainties and their impact on confidence, our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections were revised down. At the same time, indexing the TLTRO III rates to the main refinancing operations rate and the deposit facility rate implies that, should the ECB adjust these key interest rates, the average funding conditions under the programme would be correspondingly adjusted for banks, thus helping to align this programme with the broader monetary policy stance. The Governing Council decided to eliminate the 10 basis point spread over the key policy rates entailed in the initial pricing of the operations. The Governing Council therefore decided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration in order to ensure that the accommodative monetary policy stance continues to translate into favourable lending conditions, which is particularly important given that the European economy is largely bank-based."]}, {"ECB": ["Berlin, 25 September 2019  Introductory remarks    Hearing of Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9[1], Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, organised by the Committee on the Digital Agenda on the topic of \u201cDigital currencies, focusing on Libra\u201d, Deutscher Bundestag It is my pleasure to join you today to discuss the topic of digital currencies, focusing on Libra.

This lower bound, in turn, makes the conduct of monetary policy more challenging when inflation is below target. Accordingly, the greater impact on interest rates at those maturities that the negative rate policy has gives the central bank a powerful instrument to enhance transmission to the loan market.

In addition, in some cases, it proved difficult to calibrate asset purchase programs smoothly over the course of the recovery.

In the spring of 2020, when indicators of financial stress increased dramatically, the dispersion index of overnight money market rates remained at remarkably low levels, mainly owing to the structural shift to largely secured transactions and the high amounts of central bank liquidity outstanding even before the pandemic.

The new framework has important implications for the way the FOMC going forward will conduct monetary policy in support of its efforts to achieve its dual-mandate goals in a world of low neutral policy rates and persistent global disinflationary pressures. I will then provide my perspective on how these key elements of the new framework and the related forward guidance connect to the literature on conducting optimal monetary policy at\u2014and after lifting off from\u2014the ELB. In the case of the Federal Reserve, the FOMC chose a one-year memory for the inflation threshold that must be met before liftoff is considered, but it also indicated in September that the Committee expects to delay liftoff until inflation is \"on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\" Another factor I will consider in calibrating the pace of policy normalization post-liftoff is the average rate of PCE inflation since the new framework was adopted in August 2020\u2014a time, as it happened, that the federal funds rate was constrained at the ELB. Such a reference rule, which becomes relevant once the conditions for policy normalization have been met, is similar to the forward-looking Taylor-type rule for optimal monetary policy derived in Clarida, Gal\u00ed, and Gertler (1999)."], "FED": ["The euro area financial sector in the pandemic crisis   Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 23rd EURO FINANCE WEEK  Frankfurt am Main, 16 November 2020 [updated on 16 November 2020 at 10:50 CET] I am honoured to open the 23rd Euro Finance Week. The economic impact of the pandemic is highly skewed at the sector level. Loan guarantees, tax deferrals and direct transfers have alleviated immediate liquidity constraints for many firms, thus keeping a lid on insolvencies during the acute phase of the crisis. At the same time, it contributed to amplify the liquidity pressures in the system for non-bank financial intermediaries in particular. Going forward, it is urgent to tackle structural weaknesses in the European banking sector, by reducing overcapacity and enhancing cost-efficiency to address its persistently low profitability."]}, {"ECB": ["\"It is a pleasure to be here today to talk about the future of economics with the next generation of economists who will shape it.

In particular, the macroprudential framework for the non-bank financial sector is still in its infancy, which limits the ability of authorities to address emerging risks and vulnerabilities. The widening in net asset value spreads for exchange-traded funds, which was the largest on record for these instruments, also pointed towards a remarkable decline in liquidity (see right chart slide 4).[4]  In short, key parts of the financial system froze. It instantly addressed the issue of illiquidity, instilled confidence and thereby reduced systemic stress and bond spreads (see slides 3 and 4).
