       "[['\" Good morning. I very much appreciate your invitation to speak today. The theme of this ninth annual Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Policy Summit, \"Housing, Human Capital, and Inequality,\" could not be timelier. Almost no community in America has escaped the effects of the economic downturn, but many low- and moderate-income communities were hit especially hard, including a large number in and around our host city of Cleveland. As one sobering example, almost 10 percent of current Cleveland residents who have ever taken out a mortgage have a foreclosure reflected on their credit report--a rate double that of the rest of the nation\\\\. I will focus today on the state of the housing market and emphasize developments pertaining to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. I will then discuss policy initiatives to address some of the challenges confronting the housing market.The State of the Housing Market\\nAs you know, house prices are a critical element in understanding the state of the housing market. Nationally, house prices have been falling for six years, and most industry analysts expect further declines before prices bottom out. Households are equally pessimistic about the trajectory of house prices. According to one prominent survey, only 15 percent of homeowners expect house prices to increase over the next year, and barely half expect house price increases over the next five years\\\\. Largely because of the fall in house prices and the sustained high rate of unemployment, about 4-1/2 percent of mortgages in the United States are currently in foreclosure, and three or more payments have been missed on an additional 3-1/2 percent. In total, 2-1/2 million foreclosures were initiated in 2010, and a similar number of foreclosure starts are expected in 2011.One factor depressing house prices is the large number of \"distressed\" home sales. A distressed sale occurs when a borrower sells a house through a short sale or when a lender sells a property that it acquired through a foreclosure; these sales have represented about half of all home sales in recent months. The condition of the property can deteriorate considerably over the course of the foreclosure proceedings, and these damaged properties are typically sold to the next buyer at a significant discount. Commonly, market values of properties and the selling price of similar homes in the neighborhood become depressed as a consequence. The blight associated with these properties can further depress the value of nearby homes.Housing market conditions are also being hurt by the large inventory of empty and unsold homes in the United States. Nearly 2 million homes were estimated to be vacant in the first quarter of 2011. Although this number is down some from the highs seen in 2008, it is about 60 percent higher than the average level over the 20 years before the 2008 surge. And, with the pipeline of delinquent and foreclosed homes overflowing, the inventory of empty and unsold homes will likely stay elevated for some time, which will maintain downward pressure on house prices and damp construction of new homes.Recovery in the housing market is being restrained further by tight mortgage credit. According to the Federal Reserve\\'s April 2011 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, commercial banks have begun to ease standards on credit card and other consumer loans, but they have not yet started to ease standards for residential mortgages, even for those extended to borrowers in the prime market\\\\. One sign of this tight credit is the higher credit scores on recent mortgage originations. For example, the median credit score on a prime mortgage originated to purchase a home rose from around 740 in the 2005-07 period to around 780 since mid-2010. Part of this rise may reflect borrower characteristics--perhaps demand for housing has fallen more among borrowers with lower credit scores--but tighter terms and standards undoubtedly play a significant role. These tight standards indicate that some households that might like to purchase a home simply can\\'t obtain the credit to do so.Under these circumstances, it\\'s not surprising that the demand for housing remains weak. Builders of new homes overwhelmingly report \"low to very low\" traffic of prospective buyers, as well as expectations of \"poor\" sales in the months ahead. Similarly, about one-third of the respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey noted weaker demand for mortgages in the first quarter of 2011. Demand is low, in part, because households remain uncertain about the durability of the economic recovery and therefore do not want to commit to such a large investment--especially an investment that may decline further in price.Although economists may disagree about which of these factors is playing the largest role in the ongoing fall in house prices, all agree that the collapse has left deep scars on many American families and their financial well-being. The drop in house prices is a major factor in the sharp declines in household net worth during the recession. Newly released data from the Federal Reserve Board\\'s 2007-09 Survey of Consumer Finances panel, for example, indicate that the typical homeowner saw a drop in his or her real net worth of about 19 percent over the 2007-09 period. For some homeowners, the loss in net worth was much larger; indeed, nearly one-fourth of homeowners saw their net worth drop by 50 percent or more\\\\. House prices have continued to decline, on net, since 2009, and at this time, more than one-fourth of mortgage borrowers are underwater--that is, have mortgage balances that exceed the current values of their homes. Because of their negative equity stake, many households cannot take advantage of lower interest rates by refinancing their mortgages, nor can they easily sell their homes to pursue better job opportunities elsewhere. In addition, borrowers who are underwater--especially those who also experience a job loss or a cut in work hours or wages--are more likely to default on their mortgages and possibly face foreclosure.One consequence of the weak demand for housing and the sky-high rate of foreclosures has been a significant drop in the homeownership rate. After fluctuating in a fairly narrow range around 64 percent for nearly three decades, the homeownership rate rose significantly between 1994 and 2004, reaching a peak of 69 percent. Since then, however, the homeownership rate has retraced about half of its earlier increase as many former homeowners have moved into rental housing or made other living arrangements, such as moving in with family members.Are there any bright spots in this gloomy picture? As the macroeconomy has begun to improve, albeit at an uneven rate, the share of homeowners becoming newly delinquent on their mortgages--that is, missing a payment for the first time--has decreased. In addition, low interest rates and lower house prices have made homeownership potentially more affordable. In fact, by one measure, housing is hovering around its most affordable level in the 22-year history of the series\\\\. Of course, tight credit standards have precluded many households from taking advantage of the affordable conditions. Over time, however, as the economy continues to grow and credit conditions improve, more households should be able to benefit from the greater affordability.The Housing Market in Low- and Moderate-Income Communities\\nAs I indicated earlier--and as many of you already know--these sobering national trends have had even more devastating effects in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. To investigate this issue further, researchers at the Federal Reserve classified neighborhoods into three broad categories: low and moderate income, middle income, and high income\\\\. A comparison of housing and mortgage market conditions in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods with conditions in high-income neighborhoods reveals several interesting facts\\\\. One notable fact is that house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods rose more than in other neighborhoods during the national boom in house prices, and subsequently fell more during the bust. For example, from 1998 through 2006, house prices, as measured by the CoreLogic repeat-sales house price index, rose 11 percent per year on average in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, compared with 9 percent per year in high-income neighborhoods. Likewise, during the bust from 2007 to 2010, house prices fell 8 percent per year in lower-income neighborhoods, compared with 7 percent per year in high-income neighborhoods. House price changes also varied more across lower-income neighborhoods than high-income neighborhoods, implying that a greater share of lower-income neighborhoods exhibited price swings that were more dramatic than the overall average.Linked inextricably to the volatility in house prices in these communities was the volatility of mortgage lending. Mortgage lending surged in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods during the housing boom, and subsequently contracted sharply. Over 2003 to 2006, purchase mortgage originations increased 60 percent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods but less than 20 percent in high-income neighborhoods. 8 Unfortunately, during this surge in lending many borrowers were encouraged to take out subprime mortgages with teaser rates and prepayment penalties as well as alt-A mortgages with negative amortization features. When these markets collapsed, precipitating an overall tightening in credit conditions, mortgage originations through 2009 fell by 65 percent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and 50 percent in high-income neighborhoods.The greater decline in house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods has had several unfortunate consequences for mortgage borrowers. As of March 2011, borrowers with prime mortgages who lived in these neighborhoods were twice as likely to be underwater as borrowers with prime mortgages in high-income neighborhoods. Because houses are, on average, a much larger share of assets for homeowners in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, these homeowners had few other assets to draw upon to compensate for the drop in house prices\\\\. As a result, borrowers in these neighborhoods who suffered a job loss or other economic misfortune were more likely to default on their mortgages. Indeed, 13 percent of mortgages originated to borrowers in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods were 90 days or more overdue in the first quarter of 2011, compared with 6 percent of mortgages originated to borrowers in high-income neighborhoods.The higher rates of delinquency suggest that homeownership may have been a riskier proposition over the past decade for households in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods than in high-income neighborhoods. Delinquency rates are higher, in part, because borrowers in these communities were more likely to end up in complicated or inappropriate mortgage products, unacceptably often as a result of unfair and deceptive lending practices. But borrowers in these communities may also be more sensitive to house price declines because they may have fewer financial resources outside of housing, and they may have had little equity in the property to begin with\\\\.0 Although investing in a home has risks, it also has positive qualities. Households may feel more comfortable investing in housing than in other investments because houses are familiar, tangible, and provide concrete ties to the community. Regular mortgage payments may serve as a useful savings commitment device. Finally, homes pay out a \"dividend\" in the form of housing services--that is, providing a place to live. The housing services provided by an owner-occupied home--such as control over one\\'s own space--may be preferable to those provided by a rental.In making a decision about homeownership, prospective buyers need to consider the risks as well as the benefits--in particular, the possibility that house prices can fall and that such declines can have long-lasting effects on their financial well-being. The current decline in national house prices and the preceding run-up were, of course, unusually large even by historical standards. But even during times when house prices were rising nationally, prices fell steeply in certain local markets, such as Texas in the mid-1980s or Massachusetts in the early 1990s. And homeowners are not alone in their difficulty in predicting house prices: The record of industry analysts and economists is also mixed. Although many professionals understood that house values were high at the peak of the recent cycle--probably unsustainably so--there was no consensus about the extent or severity of the coming fall\\\\.1 In light of this experience, it makes sense to think about the development of wealth-building vehicles for low- and moderate-income households that have some of the desirable qualities of homeownership as an investment, but perhaps have less of the risk. Such instruments should be simple and transparent and might include a savings commitment component. Although households will likely need to take on some risk in order to accumulate wealth, the risk should not have the potential to destroy a household\\'s financial security. Continued research in this area is badly needed.Looking Forward\\nLooking forward, I unfortunately can envision no quick or easy solutions for the problems still afflicting the housing market. Even once it begins to take hold, recovery in the housing market likely will be a long, drawn-out process. For its part, the Federal Reserve will continue to use its policy tools to support the economic recovery and carry out its dual mandate to foster maximum employment in the context of price stability. As the economic recovery progresses and potential homebuyers become more confident about the durability of the recovery, it seems probable that more families will be willing to enter the housing market.The other factors weighing on the housing market--the high share of distressed sales, the large inventory of vacant homes, and tight mortgage credit--are not affected as directly by macroeconomic policy. Alleviating these conditions will require a different set of responses. Next I will discuss some Federal Reserve initiatives in these areas, and highlight areas in which work still remains to be done.The high share of distressed sales and the large inventory of vacant homes stem, in large part, from the elevated levels of foreclosures. Federal Reserve officials have stated time and again over the past several years that we believe that lenders and servicers should work actively with troubled borrowers to pursue mortgage modifications whenever possible. The consequences of not conducting modifications are simply too high--for borrowers, for lenders, for the local communities, and for the overall economy.In the event that a borrower in default no longer wishes to remain in the home, we have urged lenders to make every effort to pursue alternatives to foreclosure, such as short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure\\\\.2 These alternatives may help the borrower transition to a better housing situation as quickly and seamlessly as possible. In addition, these alternatives may shorten the length of time that a property lies vacant. The deterioration of a property while it lies vacant not only reduces the market value of the property, but also imposes considerable costs on the surrounding community by depressing the prices of neighboring homes, attracting crime, and creating financial burdens for local governments.The effects of vacant homes on local communities are an example of what economists call a negative externality--that is, an action taken by one party that imposes an uncompensated burden on another. In this case, the externality occurs because lenders, investors, and servicers typically do not bear the burdens resulting from the negative effects of foreclosures on neighborhood house prices, crime, and government budgets. As a result, fewer short sales likely occur than would be best for communities overall. This externality is one of the reasons why a government program that provides financial incentives to servicers and borrowers for pursuing short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure remains undersubscribed\\\\.3 Indeed, as of March 2011, only about 12,000 agreements had been initiated under the program. This is an area where lenders can and certainly should do more.The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with other financial banking regulators and government agencies, has embarked on initiatives to help resolve the existing stock of vacant properties and prevent even more properties from entering foreclosure\\\\.4 The first initiative involves revisions to the rules governing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) that took effect in January. Under the revised rules, depository institutions receive positive consideration in CRA examinations for participating in community stabilization activities in areas designated as eligible for funds under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program authorized by the Congress. Such activities might include donating properties that they\\'ve taken possession of--known as real estate owned--to nonprofit housing organizations or providing financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of foreclosed, abandoned, or vacant properties. Although it is too early to assess the effect of these CRA changes, the participation of more than 600 banks and industry stakeholders in a webinar recently hosted by the Federal Reserve indicates that there is interest and potential in this tool. Our host today, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, played a key role in envisioning these changes to the CRA rules.The second initiative, which is ongoing, is the development of uniform national servicing standards. These standards should address the proper handling of both performing and non-performing loans, including loss-mitigation procedures and foreclosure processing, and should lead to improved customer treatment and better transparency and oversight of mortgage servicers\\' processes. The intent is for servicers to be held to the same standards regardless of their regulator and regardless of whether the loans being serviced are held on the originator\\'s books, have been sold, or have been securitized. By having a common set of standards for the mortgage servicing industry, the financial regulatory agencies will emphasize the importance of servicing practices that promote the best interests of borrowers and the broader housing market.Let me turn finally to mortgage credit. No one wants to see a return to the loose lending standards that prevailed in the run-up to the crisis, but households and the economy will benefit if we can foster sustainable homeownership with an increase in responsible lending. The Federal Reserve, in coordination with other agencies, has recently published two notices of proposed rulemaking that will affect the provision of mortgage credit. I will describe these rules and explain how we are attempting to balance the objectives of better underwriting and access to credit in the rulemaking process. I should note that both rulemakings are open for comment, and we very much welcome your feedback.The first set of rules implements the risk-retention provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Broadly speaking, these provisions require issuers of all types of asset-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities, to retain 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets they securitize\\\\.5 In the run-up to the financial crisis, a disproportionate share of mortgage loans was made by lenders who funded their originations through securitizations and effectively retained none of the risk. These lenders had little financial stake in whether the borrowers ultimately repaid the mortgages--sometimes known as having skin in the game--and thus had a reduced incentive to engage in careful underwriting.The proposed rules outline a flexible menu of ways that securitizers can meet the risk-retention requirement. The proposed rules also have provisions that affect the mortgage market in particular. The rules recognize that the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lead them to retain 100 percent of the credit risk of the mortgages they securitize, and because this guarantee is currently backed by financial support from the government, the proposed rules do not require these government-sponsored enterprises to retain additional risk. Further, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rules exempt securitizations backed entirely by very high-quality mortgages--so-called qualified residential mortgages (QRMs)--from risk retention. The act directed the regulators with rulemaking authority to define QRMs taking into account \"underwriting and product features that historical loan performance data indicate result in a lower risk of default.\" To define QRMs, regulators conducted extensive research on the types of mortgages that have low credit risk, even in stressful economic environments. Under the proposed definition, a qualified residential mortgage must be a closed-end, first-lien mortgage to purchase or refinance a one- to four-family property. Mortgage features cannot include negative amortization, interest-only payments, or the potential for large interest rate increases. Debt-to-income ratios must be conservative, and the borrower\\'s credit history must be relatively clean. Finally, the maximum loan-to-value ratio is 80 percent for purchase mortgages, with no junior lien at closing; 75 percent on rate and term refinance loans; and 70 percent on cash-out refinance loans.We know that some have expressed anxiety that this narrow definition will result in many borrowers paying higher mortgage rates or being excluded from the credit markets. However, with many creditworthy mortgages not qualifying under the QRM standards, deep funding markets for these products are more likely to develop. As a consequence, we expect that the price difference between mortgages that do and do not qualify under the QRM standard will be relatively small.Another recently proposed set of rules seeks to ensure that, from now on, all mortgages meet higher underwriting standards, regardless of whether the mortgages are sold into securitizations or retained by lenders on their balance sheets. The QRM standards must also be at least as conservative as these universal higher standards. These revisions to the regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act are also required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rules, which were released by the Board in April, establish expanded \"ability to repay\" requirements for most consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling. These rules will be finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the new independent agency created by the act.I know that we are approaching the end of this session, and I fear that my recital of the woes of the housing market may have prevented you from fully enjoying your lunch. So let me close with a reminder that although the problems in the housing market are challenging, many individuals and groups are making a difference, including several pioneering community groups here in Cleveland. We in the Federal Reserve System are pleased to support these efforts by providing data, research, and support, including facilitating important conferences and conversations like the one here today.Thank you very much for your attention. I look forward to answering any questions you might have.\"'],\n",

One notable fact is that house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods rose more than in other neighborhoods during the national boom in house prices, and subsequently fell more during the bust. For example, from 1998 through 2006, house prices, as measured by the CoreLogic repeat-sales house price index, rose 11 percent per year on average in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, compared with 9 percent per year in high-income neighborhoods. Likewise, during the bust from 2007 to 2010, house prices fell 8 percent per year in lower-income neighborhoods, compared with 7 percent per year in high-income neighborhoods. House price changes also varied more across lower-income neighborhoods than high-income neighborhoods, implying that a greater share of lower-income neighborhoods exhibited price swings that were more dramatic than the overall average.Linked inextricably to the volatility in house prices in these communities was the volatility of mortgage lending. Mortgage lending surged in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods during the housing boom, and subsequently contracted sharply. Over 2003 to 2006, purchase mortgage originations increased 60 percent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods but less than 20 percent in high-income neighborhoods. 8 Unfortunately, during this surge in lending many borrowers were encouraged to take out subprime mortgages with teaser rates and prepayment penalties as well as alt-A mortgages with negative amortization features. When these markets collapsed, precipitating an overall tightening in credit conditions, mortgage originations through 2009 fell by 65 percent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and 50 percent in high-income neighborhoods.The greater decline in house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods has had several unfortunate consequences for mortgage borrowers. As of March 2011, borrowers with prime mortgages who lived in these neighborhoods were twice as likely to be underwater as borrowers with prime mortgages in high-income neighborhoods. Because houses are, on average, a much larger share of assets for homeowners in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, these homeowners had few other assets to draw upon to compensate for the drop in house prices\\\\. As a result, borrowers in these neighborhoods who suffered a job loss or other economic misfortune were more likely to default on their mortgages. Indeed, 13 percent of mortgages originated to borrowers in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods were 90 days or more overdue in the first quarter of 2011, compared with 6 percent of mortgages originated to borrowers in high-income neighborhoods.The higher rates of delinquency suggest that homeownership may have been a riskier proposition over the past decade for households in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods than in high-income neighborhoods. Delinquency rates are higher, in part, because borrowers in these communities were more likely to end up in complicated or inappropriate mortgage products, unacceptably often as a result of unfair and deceptive lending practices. But borrowers in these communities may also be more sensitive to house price declines because they may have fewer financial resources outside of housing, and they may have had little equity in the property to begin with\\\\.0 Although investing in a home has risks, it also has positive qualities. Households may feel more comfortable investing in housing than in other investments because houses are familiar, tangible, and provide concrete ties to the community. Regular mortgage payments may serve as a useful savings commitment device. Finally, homes pay out a \"dividend\" in the form of housing services--that is, providing a place to live. The housing services provided by an owner-occupied home--such as control over one\\'s own space--may be preferable to those provided by a rental.In making a decision about homeownership, prospective buyers need to consider the risks as well as the benefits--in particular, the possibility that house prices can fall and that such declines can have long-lasting effects on their financial well-being. The current decline in national house prices and the preceding run-up were, of course, unusually large even by historical standards. But even during times when house prices were rising nationally, prices fell steeply in certain local markets, such as Texas in the mid-1980s or Massachusetts in the early 1990s. And homeowners are not alone in their difficulty in predicting house prices: The record of industry analysts and economists is also mixed. Although many professionals understood that house values were high at the peak of the recent cycle--probably unsustainably so--there was no consensus about the extent or severity of the coming fall\\\\.1 In light of this experience, it makes sense to think about the development of wealth-building vehicles for low- and moderate-income households that have some of the desirable qualities of homeownership as an investment, but perhaps have less of the risk. Such instruments should be simple and transparent and might include a savings commitment component. Although households will likely need to take on some risk in order to accumulate wealth, the risk should not have the potential to destroy a household\\'s financial security. Continued research in this area is badly needed.Looking Forward\\nLooking forward, I unfortunately can envision no quick or easy solutions for the problems still afflicting the housing market. Even once it begins to take hold, recovery in the housing market likely will be a long, drawn-out process. For its part, the Federal Reserve will continue to use its policy tools to support the economic recovery and carry out its dual mandate to foster maximum employment in the context of price stability. As the economic recovery progresses and potential homebuyers become more confident about the durability of the recovery, it seems probable that more families will be willing to enter the housing market.The other factors weighing on the housing market--the high share of distressed sales, the large inventory of vacant homes, and tight mortgage credit--are not affected as directly by macroeconomic policy. Alleviating these conditions will require a different set of responses. Next I will discuss some Federal Reserve initiatives in these areas, and highlight areas in which work still remains to be done.The high share of distressed sales and the large inventory of vacant homes stem, in large part, from the elevated levels of foreclosures. Federal Reserve officials have stated time and again over the past several years that we believe that lenders and servicers should work actively with troubled borrowers to pursue mortgage modifications whenever possible. The consequences of not conducting modifications are simply too high--for borrowers, for lenders, for the local communities, and for the overall economy.In the event that a borrower in default no longer wishes to remain in the home, we have urged lenders to make every effort to pursue alternatives to foreclosure, such as short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure\\\\.2 These alternatives may help the borrower transition to a better housing situation as quickly and seamlessly as possible. In addition, these alternatives may shorten the length of time that a property lies vacant. The deterioration of a property while it lies vacant not only reduces the market value of the property, but also imposes considerable costs on the surrounding community by depressing the prices of neighboring homes, attracting crime, and creating financial burdens for local governments.The effects of vacant homes on local communities are an example of what economists call a negative externality--that is, an action taken by one party that imposes an uncompensated burden on another. In this case, the externality occurs because lenders, investors, and servicers typically do not bear the burdens resulting from the negative effects of foreclosures on neighborhood house prices, crime, and government budgets. As a result, fewer short sales likely occur than would be best for communities overall. This externality is one of the reasons why a government program that provides financial incentives to servicers and borrowers for pursuing short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure remains undersubscribed\\\\.3 Indeed, as of March 2011, only about 12,000 agreements had been initiated under the program. This is an area where lenders can and certainly should do more.The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with other financial banking regulators and government agencies, has embarked on initiatives to help resolve the existing stock of vacant properties and prevent even more properties from entering foreclosure\\\\.4 The first initiative involves revisions to the rules governing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) that took effect in January. Under the revised rules, depository institutions receive positive consideration in CRA examinations for participating in community stabilization activities in areas designated as eligible for funds under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program authorized by the Congress. Such activities might include donating properties that they\\'ve taken possession of--known as real estate owned--to nonprofit housing organizations or providing financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of foreclosed, abandoned, or vacant properties. Although it is too early to assess the effect of these CRA changes, the participation of more than 600 banks and industry stakeholders in a webinar recently hosted by the Federal Reserve indicates that there is interest and potential in this tool. Our host today, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, played a key role in envisioning these changes to the CRA rules.The second initiative, which is ongoing, is the development of uniform national servicing standards. These standards should address the proper handling of both performing and non-performing loans, including loss-mitigation procedures and foreclosure processing, and should lead to improved customer treatment and better transparency and oversight of mortgage servicers\\' processes. The intent is for servicers to be held to the same standards regardless of their regulator and regardless of whether the loans being serviced are held on the originator\\'s books, have been sold, or have been securitized. By having a common set of standards for the mortgage servicing industry, the financial regulatory agencies will emphasize the importance of servicing practices that promote the best interests of borrowers and the broader housing market.Let me turn finally to mortgage credit. No one wants to see a return to the loose lending standards that prevailed in the run-up to the crisis, but households and the economy will benefit if we can foster sustainable homeownership with an increase in responsible lending. The Federal Reserve, in coordination with other agencies, has recently published two notices of proposed rulemaking that will affect the provision of mortgage credit. I will describe these rules and explain how we are attempting to balance the objectives of better underwriting and access to credit in the rulemaking process. I should note that both rulemakings are open for comment, and we very much welcome your feedback.The first set of rules implements the risk-retention provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Broadly speaking, these provisions require issuers of all types of asset-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities, to retain 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets they securitize\\\\.5 In the run-up to the financial crisis, a disproportionate share of mortgage loans was made by lenders who funded their originations through securitizations and effectively retained none of the risk. These lenders had little financial stake in whether the borrowers ultimately repaid the mortgages--sometimes known as having skin in the game--and thus had a reduced incentive to engage in careful underwriting.The proposed rules outline a flexible menu of ways that securitizers can meet the risk-retention requirement. The proposed rules also have provisions that affect the mortgage market in particular. The rules recognize that the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lead them to retain 100 percent of the credit risk of the mortgages they securitize, and because this guarantee is currently backed by financial support from the government, the proposed rules do not require these government-sponsored enterprises to retain additional risk. Further, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rules exempt securitizations backed entirely by very high-quality mortgages--so-called qualified residential mortgages (QRMs)--from risk retention. The act directed the regulators with rulemaking authority to define QRMs taking into account \"underwriting and product features that historical loan performance data indicate result in a lower risk of default.\" To define QRMs, regulators conducted extensive research on the types of mortgages that have low credit risk, even in stressful economic environments. Under the proposed definition, a qualified residential mortgage must be a closed-end, first-lien mortgage to purchase or refinance a one- to four-family property. Mortgage features cannot include negative amortization, interest-only payments, or the potential for large interest rate increases. Debt-to-income ratios must be conservative, and the borrower\\'s credit history must be relatively clean. Finally, the maximum loan-to-value ratio is 80 percent for purchase mortgages, with no junior lien at closing; 75 percent on rate and term refinance loans; and 70 percent on cash-out refinance loans.We know that some have expressed anxiety that this narrow definition will result in many borrowers paying higher mortgage rates or being excluded from the credit markets. However, with many creditworthy mortgages not qualifying under the QRM standards, deep funding markets for these products are more likely to develop. As a consequence, we expect that the price difference between mortgages that do and do not qualify under the QRM standard will be relatively small.Another recently proposed set of rules seeks to ensure that, from now on, all mortgages meet higher underwriting standards, regardless of whether the mortgages are sold into securitizations or retained by lenders on their balance sheets. The QRM standards must also be at least as conservative as these universal higher standards. These revisions to the regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act are also required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rules, which were released by the Board in April, establish expanded \"ability to repay\" requirements for most consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling. These rules will be finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the new independent agency created by the act.I know that we are approaching the end of this session, and I fear that my recital of the woes of the housing market may have prevented you from fully enjoying your lunch. So let me close with a reminder that although the problems in the housing market are challenging, many individuals and groups are making a difference, including several pioneering community groups here in Cleveland. We in the Federal Reserve System are pleased to support these efforts by providing data, research, and support, including facilitating important conferences and conversations like the one here today.Thank you very much for your attention. I look forward to answering any questions you might have.\"'],\n",

       " {'ECB': ['  Adjusting monetary policy in a challenging environment   Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the “ECB and its Watchers XIII” conference, Frankfurt am Main, 10 June 2011  1. Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here today at the thirteenth in this series of conferences entitled “The ECB and its Watchers”.  The theme of this session is the return to normality. It assumes that we know what the “new normal” will look like. What we do know is that it will be different from the “old normal”, as the crisis has changed the economic and financial environment in many ways. But it is still too early to characterise what exactly the new normal will look like, also because the crisis is still ongoing. [1] Therefore, rather than talking about going back to normal, I prefer to talk about adjustments to policies.  Indeed, during the period of acute financial stress we have seen many changes in the area of economic and prudential policies. However, this is far less the case for the ECB’s monetary policy. Our main objective which is to maintain price stability for the euro area as a whole over the medium term has remained unchanged. Of course, exceptional circumstances have called for extraordinary measures. In response to the crisis, we lowered our key interest rates in an unprecedented manner. We have also introduced a number of non-standard measures to support the transmission of our interest rate decisions to the euro area economy. All these measures have lent considerable support to economic activity, while remaining fully aligned with our deep-rooted aim of maintaining price stability.  Now, economic recovery in the euro area is on a more self-sustained path. Looking ahead, we expect the economy to further benefit from ongoing global growth and the still accommodative monetary policy stance. At the same time, for some months by now, we have been observing relatively high inflation rates and continued upward pressure on prices. Overall, we see risks to price stability on the upside. This calls for strong vigilance. In this respect, we stand ready to further adjust our still very accommodative monetary policy stance. In the same vein, we will act in a timely manner as regards further steps to phase out our non-standard measures. The concrete steps of adjustment will remain guided by our aim of keeping inflation in the euro area below, but close to, 2% over the medium term for the euro area as a whole. In my contribution today, I will emphasise that the ECB conducts monetary policy ”as usual”. In particular, after briefly recalling the motives for our April interest rate increase, I shall elaborate on how the ECB deals with the particular challenges prevailing, namely [SLIDE 2: OUTLINE]   inflation pressures stemming from commodity prices   costs of keeping interest rates low for too long   the adjustment to the monetary policy stance with some non-standard measures still in place, and   divergent macroeconomic and financial developments in the countries of the euro area.     2. Commodity prices and the outlook for price stability On 7 April we increased our key interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was the first policy move since May 2009. It was mainly driven by upside risks to price stability, in particular relating to further increases in energy and commodity prices. Continued upward pressure on overall inflation is discernible in the early stages of the production process. It has the potential to translate into inflation expectations, broad based second-round effects in price and wage-setting and inflationary pressures over the medium term.  As mentioned, we continue to see upside risks to price stability. Signals from the monetary analysis indicate that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. At the same time monetary liquidity remains ample. It could accommodate upward price pressures. [SLIDES 3 AND 4: EXCESS MONETARTY LIQUIDITY and M3 AND UNDERLYING M3]  In addition, strong economic growth in emerging markets likely contributes further to commodity price rises. Ample liquidity at the global level could support this development. The monetary policy stance of many central banks around the world also remains very accommodative. This creates an environment which is raising inflationary challenges, in particular for emerging economies that shadow US monetary policy [SLIDE 5: BROAD MONEY GROWTH IN ADVANCED AND EMERGING ECONOMIES].  Is the fact that inflation is being driven mainly by commodity prices not a reason to be less concerned about inflation in the medium term, as these such developments are usually temporary only? Theoretically, it is possible to look beyond the volatility in inflation triggered by first-round effects of commodity price changes if these are of a purely temporary nature. However, the central bank also needs to consider policy action in case sustained upward trends in commodity prices are seen as a risk to price stability over the medium term. We have already observed in the past that commodity prices tend to follow a secular “trend” reflecting amongst others things the fast growth in emerging economies. Moreover, if transitory rises in commodity prices ran the risk of triggering second-round effects, they may also have a more lasting impact on consumer price developments and medium-term inflation expectations. Monetary policy then needs to avert temporary inflation increases that lead to second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour, for instance due to the indexation of wages and prices to past inflation.  Today’s discussion on how to react to rising commodity prices reminds me of that prevailing in the 1970s. In the aftermath of the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979, inflation in the OECD countries increased dramatically from already relatively high levels 5.7% in 1971 to double-digit numbers 14.8% in 1980. It seems evident that this evolution, which was later labelled the “Great Inflation”, [2] was mostly driven by increasing oil prices. [3] However, Germany – and also Switzerland – was a notable exception. [4] German inflation rose from 5.2% in 1971 to 5.4% in 1980. The Bundesbank chose to tighten its monetary policy stance. This policy resulted in significantly higher real interest rates in Germany, compared to other OECD countries. This helped the economy to grow in line with its potential. Moreover, on account of the associated appreciation of the D-Mark, the oil price increase had a more limited direct impact on inflation. Overall, the different inflation experiences of the 1970s clearly demonstrate that the “Great Inflation” was not only the result of rising oil prices but to a large extent driven by different monetary policies. Faced today with rising commodity prices we should not forget this lesson, a fortiori in a context of globally loose monetary policies and ample liquidity.  3. Costs of keeping interest rates low over a long period Maintaining our medium-term focus is particularly important in the current environment. Short-term volatility is extensive and uncertainty remains unusually high. Thus, central banks need to avoid just looking at the short-term consequences of a somewhat tighter monetary policy stance and take a longer-term perspective. This should include the costs and related risks to price stability that may arise if interest rates are kept too low for too long.  The risks associated with keeping interest rates low for too long a period have been clearly exposed and documented in several recent analytical contributions. The period prior to the financial crisis has demonstrated that global policy accommodation for a protracted period of time can inadvertently distort incentives and behaviour in the financial sector. Low interest rates over too long a period foster an under-pricing of risk [5], inducing excessive risk-taking. And low interest rates delay and ultimately prevent the necessary repair of balance sheets. In the end, this turns low interest rates into a curse. It does not only hinder strong and sustainable economic growth but also compromises price stability over the medium term. Nonetheless, the current global policy debate seems to favour the same asymmetric approach that characterised the pre-crisis conventional wisdom, the so called Jackson-Hole consensus – to which the ECB never subscribed – and which can be summarised in three elements:    aggressive policy easing when financial developments turn sour;   postponing the exit from low rates even when conditions improve, for fear of harming the economic recovery;    no policy reaction to domestic and global liquidity over and above what is requested by standard inflation forecasts at standard horizons.    Undoubtedly, this asymmetric approach at the global level contributed to the financial crisis.  In contrast to this, the two-pillar strategy of the ECB follows a more structured approach. It currently indicates that improvements in monetary, credit and financial conditions require an adjustment to the monetary policy stance. Empirical evidence shows that, also in the past, monetary policy in the euro area reacted symmetrically to signals coming from monetary and credit conditions. [6] This symmetry has contributed to limiting financial imbalances and will continue to provide a clear medium-term focus.  Does the above imply that the ECB is carefree as regards current economic developments? Of course not. We are aware of the risks surrounding the current pace of economic expansion. But easy money cannot and will not address the root causes of the crisis. Homework needs to be done on the fiscal side. Governments need to strengthen decisively public finances. We need a safer financial system. This requires improving the capital position of banks and tighter regulation. Central banks can not be expected to continuously prolong measures to compensate for lingering risks from the financial system.   4. Interest rates and non-standard measures Do liquidity support measures constrain the conduct of monetary policy? Decisions on policy interest rates and on non-standard measures are largely separated: as always, we set interest rates to maintain price stability, while our non-standard measures support the transmission of monetary policy.  Nevertheless, to some extent, the two decisions are also interlinked. The fixed-rate full-allotment procedure in all refinancing operations, for instance, created large amounts of excess liquidity, as observed, in particular, over the lifetime of the 1-year LTROs, driven by strong demand from banks, which resulted in short-term money market rates (such as the EONIA) falling below the rate of the main refinancing operations [SLIDE 6:ECB INTEREST RATES AND THE EONIA]. Movements in the EONIA have further trickled down the EONIA swap curve at different maturities. The money market rate therefore does not unambiguously reflect the stance of monetary policy in the same way as in the past.  The MRO rate will become more relevant again in the future, signalling our monetary policy stance. This implies that the overnight rate will be close to the MRO rate. We already see that interbank markets are performing better, as shown for instance by the decreasing dependency of banks on ECB refinancing operations. Recourse to these operations has declined significantly from close to €900 billion in June 2010 to around €430 billion today [SLIDE 7: BANKS’ PARTICIPATION IN EUROSYSTEM REFINANCING OPERATIONS].   5. Monetary policy and heterogeneity In public debates, viability of the euro has again been questioned on the ground that the financial crisis has deepened the economic divide across member states. But the ECB’s monetary policy continues to be geared towards price stability in the euro area as a whole. The single monetary policy of the ECB cannot address different economic growth or inflation across regions of the euro area. Such macroeconomic heterogeneity is a normal feature within a monetary union. Heterogeneity can even be a desirable feature when it reflects the necessary adjustments to macroeconomic imbalances that have built up.  Macroeconomic diversity is an issue that national policy-makers should deal with, not the ECB. Their primary contribution of course would be to avoid building up unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances. Indeed, the bulk of the current imbalances in some euro area countries reflect that countries have insufficiently internalised the participation in a monetary union into domestic policies. To fully realise the benefits of EMU requires national policies to adapt to EMU. This applies to the areas of fiscal policy (including taxation), structural reforms, regulation and banking supervision. Without this, imbalances will inevitably reoccur, challenging the proper functioning of EMU and thus of monetary policy. It is essential to put in place a European framework that is incentive-compatible and credibly enforceable, to avoid the re-emergence of significant imbalances. National policies should be fully guided by the framework. Does this then imply that monetary policy completely ignores developments in individual euro area countries of the euro area? No, but specific national developments play a role for monetary policy only to the extent that they have an impact on the medium-term outlook and risks for price stability in the euro area as a whole.  Maintaining price stability for the entire euro area is the central contribution the ECB’s monetary policy makes with a view to supporting sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. Any other monetary policy would come at the cost of lower medium-term growth, for instance on account of higher longer-term interest rates or reduced confidence on the part of economic agents.   6. Concluding remarks Let me conclude.  For the main elements of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, there is no need for adjustment as these elements have not changed during the crisis. We will do all that is needed to ensure price stability over the medium term. We will change the monetary policy stance whenever necessary. There is no pre-defined sequence as regards interest rate decisions and the decisions on the phasing-out of non-standard measures.  Monetary policy will continue to be orientated towards the medium term, taking into account macroeconomic effects that take place after the initial effect, including effects on the incentive-structures of economic agents caused by keeping interest rates low over a long period. In this respect, we rely on the structured approach provided by our two-pillar strategy. Likewise, the ECB’s single monetary policy will continue to be geared towards the euro area as a whole, not just a small part of it.  The times of crisis have shown that we in the Governing Council of the ECB are strongly determined to deliver what we are expected to deliver: price stability in the euro area in the medium term. The continuation of well-anchored inflation expectations in the euro area illustrates the credibility we have achieved in reaching our objective. For this objective, and this one alone, the ECB can be held accountable.  For other policy areas, national policy-makers and authorities need to take full responsibility. National authorities need to address outstanding imbalances urgently, by restoring fiscal sustainability and by putting the financial sector on a healthy footing. Embarking on this path would also ensure that the single monetary policy fits all.

       "  'FED': ['  How will historians judge our handling of this crisis?   Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, in the occasion of the presentation of the book titled “Un Siglo de Historia del Sistema Financiero Español”, Banco de EspañaMadrid, 10 June 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak today at the Bank of Spain about the Spanish financial sector. The book being presented today consists of a distinguished collection of essays providing a wealth of information on Spain’s financial sector over the last century. Not only does it summarise the key data and the main developments, but it also provides deep analyses. It will definitely become the work of reference on the history of the financial sector in this country in the 20th century. Let me then congratulate the contributors and the editors, José Luis Malo de Molina and Pablo Martín Aceña for their excellent work. Reading the book, notably the chapter by Raimundo Poveda, we can draw some interesting parallels between the current crisis and the banking crisis in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In particular, given the current circumstances, the main message I would like to emphasise today is that certain changes in the banking sector that are implemented in response to crises are essential to guarantee a strong, robust banking sector in the future. In other words, the implementation of reforms and changes in the banking sector after a banking crisis – in respect of business practices, regulation and supervision – has the potential to strengthen the foundations of the banking sector, thereby improving its ability to contribute to sustainable economic growth.  Given the limited time that I have, I will focus on some key structural developments in the banking sector that have taken place over the past twenty years and that are described and analysed in several chapters of the book. In addition, I will examine how the regulations introduced by the Bank of Spain during the boom years helped to prevent and mitigate the negative effects of the crisis and, especially, how some of the reforms and structural changes that are currently being considered may substantially reduce the fragilities of the banking sector. If implemented, they will strengthen the banking system and ultimately have positive effects on financial stability and economic growth in Spain.  Some reflections on banking developments during the last two decades As I see it, Spain’s banking sector has undergone two fundamental changes since 1990: banking liberalisation and financial innovation.  Banking liberalisation has produced a notable increase in competition among institutions and in financial integration. For example, the cajas (savings banks) have started to compete geographically and in different business segments. The increased competition has also led, at different times during these 20 years, to strong competition for bank deposits (e.g. la “guerra del pasivo” at the end of the 80s). In general, banking competition brings very positive aspects for the real economy and to welfare, and there is no doubt that liberalisation of the banking sector in Spain has been very positive for the country. However, we should bear in mind, as some chapters of the book point out, that too much competition may significantly increase bank risk-taking and that this may have negative implications and that this may undermine financial stability. [1] The recent very intense competition for retail deposits may also be a notable example in this regard. Another important aspect of liberalisation has been the internationalisation of the banking sector, which is very well explained in the book. I would like to stress two aspects of this phenomenon: i) the foreign expansion by Spanish banks (particularly Santander and BBVA), and ii) the significant dependence on foreign liquidity (mainly through international wholesale markets), especially after the introduction of the euro. [2]  Expansion abroad, when it is well executed, definitely brings benefits in terms of geographical diversification, which have become clear during the crisis, however a reliance on funding from abroad may bring some fragility if that source of liquidity dries up, as the crisis has shown. [3] In previous banking crises, banks typically suffered from runs on retail deposits, whereas nowadays these runs are wholesale-based. [4] In the light of this, the sector should aim to diversify its sources of funding liquidity. The second defining element over the past decades has been the increase in financial innovation, notably in securitisation and market funding. Securitisation can have many positive effects, e.g. by increasing the supply of bank credit to the private sector thanks to greater bank liquidity. Some crucial segments of the economy, such as small and medium-sized firms, may also significantly benefit from the development of securitisation. At the same time, recent research has shown that securitisation may lead to a lowering of banking standards and ultimately weaken financial stability. [5] Once a bank is no longer responsible for a loan that it has made, it has fewer incentives to monitor that loan. Besides, in periods of extensive securitisation, when the bank knows that new loans can be securitised – which in some countries can imply that the risk will be totally borne by investors outside the bank – the ex ante incentives for screening are notably reduced. All these important changes in the banking industry have taken place against an ostensibly benign but potential dangerous macroeconomic backdrop: the so-called Great Moderation. Indeed, the protracted period of high economic growth and low short and long-term interest rates contributed to giving the banking sector some very good years. However, that is precisely when risk builds up – and it can be excessive. [6] Moreover, we should not overlook that macro fragilities emerged during the benign macroeconomic context: for example, both the current account deficit and the share of the real estate sector activity were around 10% of GDP in 2006. All these elements contributed to a credit boom throughout the Spanish economy, particularly in the real estate sector. In this context, let me add that – crucially – the Bank of Spain reacted very well: notably by introducing a strict regulatory system for special purpose vehicles which significantly restricted regulatory capital arbitrage, and by introducing dynamic provisions, which may have reduced the very high credit supply in the good years. Without those measures the credit boom could have been even bigger. [7] Moreover, the provision buffers have been vital during the crisis as they have allowed banks to continue supporting credit availability.  The crisis calls for change Some key features of the recent crisis have been, in my view, the fragility both on the liability and asset sides of banks, coupled with a densely interlinked global financial sector. Banks’ capital reserves, transparency, funding, risk management, corporate governance and both micro and, especially, macro supervision and regulation need to be adjusted. Let me start with the fragile liabilities. We have experienced since August 2007 a funding liquidity dry-up. As I said before, in the run-up to the crisis, Spanish banks were highly dependent on foreign wholesale funding. As a result, the sector as a whole ended up suffering and some of the more dependent banks have been hit very badly. But bank liquidity also depends crucially on bank capital and, hence, banks with stronger balance sheets suffer much less from a lack of liquidity. [8] The liquidity provided by the Eurosystem has been vital to minimise the liquidity shortages, but bank capital needs to be stronger so that all banks have access to private funding liquidity.  Fragile assets were an important factor too, as very high volumes of credit (and risk) were granted during the good years. Some banks took more risk than others in the real estate bubble, and some banks recorded substantially lower profits and higher (realized and potential) loan losses during the current crisis. Hence, bank capital significantly decreased, especially for some groups of cajas; they, moreover, cannot easily raise capital because of their specific structure. The availability of bank capital is essential for two additional reasons: First, a bank capital crunch may lead to a credit crunch. Thus, in order to help the real economy recover, some weak banks need to be recapitalised. This is why the recent regulatory changes on capital in Spain are crucial. [9]  Banking assets are however opaque, which – combined with the high leverage – make recapitalisation in private markets difficult, especially in crisis periods.  Therefore, to reduce these problems, high transparency is extremely important: the stress tests and Bank of Spain’s publications on key bank variables are thus indispensable. If, after these exercises to promote transparency, some small groups of banks cannot fulfil the capital requirements, restructuring may be the only solution. Banks are still too highly exposed to real estate assets in their balance sheets and so the new haircuts introduced by the Bank of Spain go in the right direction. Geographical diversification (notably the internationalisation of some banks) and better risk management are also crucial factors, I believe, in addressing the current challenges. But also the strengthening of corporate governance is of utmost importance to avoid excessive risk-taking. In other words, transparency and risk management are important, as I said, but incentives as well! In this sense, the restructuring of some groups of banks may be vital.   Second, looking into the future, with the crisis behind us, higher bank capital requirements will also play a positive role by reducing incentives for excessive bank risk-taking.  On that same subject, we should welcome the changes made to EU and global banking regulations and supervision, both micro and macro-based: for example, the Basel III package of regulations (level and quality of capital, countercyclical buffers of capital, liquidity ratio. etc) and the developments in macroprudential supervision with the establishment of the ESRB in the EU.  Concluding remarks  Changes in the banking sector after the current crisis – at national, EU and global level – can make the Spanish banking sector stronger and provide a durable support for the real economy, as happened after the 1970-80 crisis. To be specific, changes in the business models and the restructuring of some banks, more and higher-quality bank capital, better risk management, improved transparency and corporate governance, as well as changes in banking regulations and supervision – all these factors will contribute towards sustainable economic growth. However, as necessary as these changes are, they are not enough to bring about a strong and robust improvement in Spain’s economy, and particularly to create jobs and boost productivity. To achieve these objectives, further progress must be made:    in consolidating public finances, also to reduce the possible negative spillovers of the sovereign debt crisis to the banking sector;   in liberalising product and factor markets, especially now the labour market with respect to “negociación colectiva” (collective bargaining).   in improving the education system at all levels – it is critical to raising productivity over the medium term and, therefore, to improving welfare.   I truly hope that when another book like this one is written in, say 50 or 100 years’ time, the authors will conclude that the steps taken in response to the crisis in the banking and in other key sectors of the Spanish economy were the right ones and, in particular, that they played a part in overcoming the crisis and increasing in a sustainable way the well-being of the citizens of this country.

       " {'ECB': [\"  The euro, its central bank \\u2028and economic governance   Stamp Memorial Lecture by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the London School of Economics and Political ScienceLondon, 13 June 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour for me to speak here at the London School of Economics and Political Science today.  The euro and its central bank, the ECB, are unique. The European single currency is the only major currency not issued by a single sovereign state, but by a union of sovereign states.  Indeed, the European Treaties specify a clear division of responsibilities between European-level policy-making and national policy-making. For countries that have adopted the euro as their currency, this implies that, on the one hand, monetary policy is inherently indivisible, and in the euro area it is thus conducted at the supranational level by the ECB. On the other hand, fiscal policies remain largely the competence of national governments. In this lecture I would like to explore how the unique institutional framework of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe has fared over the past 12 years and particularly during the global financial crisis.  As you will be aware, the primary objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability in the euro area. In the first part of my lecture I will show how the ECB achieved this primary objective before, during and after the crisis. I will also try to convince you that the economic performance of the euro area as a whole has been quite remarkable over the past twelve and a half years. At the same time, we have to recognise that several individual countries in the euro area are facing significant challenges and that experiences during the crisis in different parts of the euro area have been quite diverse. In the second part of my lecture, I will address the issue of economic diversity in the euro area and show that the euro area shares this characteristic with the United States – an economy and a currency area that is a natural reference point taking into account its size. Finally, the crisis has exposed weaknesses in the economic governance framework of EMU that need to be addressed urgently. I will close my lecture with some comments about what these reforms of the economic governance framework should look like from the perspective of the ECB.  The ECB’s primary objective: Price stability in the euro area before and after the crisis I can say today that the ECB has fulfilled its primary objective to the letter. As you know, the ECB aims at inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Annual inflation over the first 12 years of EMU has been 1.97% on average. A precision landing.  More generally, the degree of price stability has been greater, over the past 12 years, in the euro area as a whole than in the individual euro area countries over the previous 50 years.  This is no small achievement. The ECB has faced many challenges in pursuing its objective: the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the shock wave of 11 September 2001, the volatility of commodity prices and, of course, the worst financial crisis the world has known since the Second World War. During the crisis, together with other central banks around the world, the ECB has had to operate in an uncertain environment. Allow me to explain our monetary policy response to the crisis in more detail. Crucially, we were alert from the very first day. We were one of the first central banks to react, when the financial markets became abruptly turbulent, in August 2007, taking action swiftly. Dysfunctional financial markets threatened to compromise our ability to guide the outlook for price stability by using only our conventional instrument – interest rates. Faced with this situation, over the years that followed, we have implemented a number of unconventional measures to ensure that our decisions on interest rates are transmitted to the whole economy, despite the problems observed in the financial sector and capital markets. In particular, the major task was to allow banks – regardless of the level of the key interest rate which was designed to deliver price stability – to continue to lend to households and businesses. [See figure on non-standard measures] It is important to understand that we maintained a principle of strict separation between our conventional measures and our unconventional measures. Our interest rates are set so that we can ensure price stability over the medium term. The implementation of unconventional measures depends on the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and is intended to repair disruptions of monetary and financial markets and of specific market segments that might impede the overall transmission. As the crisis called for rapid and unprecedented action, we did not lose sight of our main objective, namely to maintain price stability over the medium term for the benefit of the 331 million citizens of the euro area. All – I stress that word – all monetary policy decisions we have taken over the last 12½ years were aimed at fulfilling this commitment. Let me elaborate on this point. As you know, in normal times, central banks mainly influence the economy and inflation by using the instrument for setting short-term interest rates. In practice, the identification, at an early stage, of the risks to price stability is a delicate task. To see it through, the ECB bases itself on a monetary policy strategy supported by several sources of information. The economic analysis we undertake enables us to synthesise information on short-term inflationary pressures from a large number of economic indicators. Thanks to the monetary analysis that we also undertake, we can cross-check this information with medium-term inflationary pressures drawn from the monetary and financial indicators. These are the two “pillars” of our monetary policy, which indicate to us the necessary steps in respect of the interest rate to ensure price stability over the medium term. The measures we have taken, sometimes in the face of political pressures have demonstrated our determination to stick to our mandate in full independence. We refused to lower interest rates in early 2004 when Germany, France and Italy in particular asked us to do so. And we did not hesitate to raise interest rates in December 2005, a time when 10 governments out of 12 in the euro area, plus many international observers, asked the ECB to leave its key rates unchanged. International financial institutions, in particular, highlighted the risks that the tightening of monetary policy – after a prolonged period of accommodative monetary policy – could pose to the recovery. Despite these warnings, we conducted our monetary tightening, and international financial institutions, with the benefit of hindsight, have agreed that we were right to make that decision. After the crisis escalated in mid-September 2008, while inflationary pressures subsided, we decided, in full accordance with our mandate, to reduce our key interest rate. We cut it rapidly, from 4.25% in October 2008 to 1% in May 2009. We lowered the key interest rate at a pace and to a level unprecedented in the recent history of the euro area countries. [See figure on monetary policy decisions] With the benefit of hindsight, the decisions we took during the crisis were, I think, vindicated. They have in particular helped to preserve a very solid anchoring of inflation expectations over the past four years. Our determination to maintain price stability over the medium term has enabled us to prevent both the risk of inflation and of deflation from materialising. With the recovery now more firmly established, we have seen in recent months upside risks to the outlook for price stability over the medium term. Again, the sharp increase in oil and other commodities has had a major impact on overall inflation. In these circumstances, the central bank must prevent increases in the prices of raw materials from being incorporated into the long-term inflation expectations, which could trigger second-round effects on wages and prices. It is against this background that the Governing Council decided in April to raise interest rates. I stressed, in reporting this decision, that it had been taken unanimously. The action of the Governing Council is motivated by a common goal. That decision in April confirmed that the separation principle is strictly applied and that our non-conventional measures do not restrict in any way our ability to toughen the monetary policy stance when facing inflationary pressures. Thus, when the Governing Council decided in April that it was time to raise interest rates, in parallel, at the same time, it decided to keep, in the second quarter, the provision of unlimited fixed-rate liquidity for a period of three months.  Contributing to economic performance Price stability is the best contribution that central banks can make to sustainable economic growth and job creation. I think there is widespread agreement on this among central bankers and academic researchers. In the short run, however, some academic research suggests that there might be a significant trade-off between low inflation volatility and low output volatility. If prices are stable, economic adjustment has to occur through the real economy channel. It may therefore be difficult to achieve these two goals at the same time.  The chart shows that the euro area scores relatively well on both dimensions. This is puzzling, given that the euro area has quite rigid product and labour markets, at least compared with the United States. The higher degree of price and wage rigidity in the euro area would suggest that output volatility should be significantly larger in the euro area than in the more flexible US economy.  [See macro volatility chart]  This would be particularly true during a period when the economy is subject to supply-side shocks, which are simultaneously exerting inflationary and recessionary influences. Yet surprisingly, and despite the negative supply-side shocks that had been hitting the euro area economy over the years up to 2007, the data suggested that both inflation volatility and output volatility in the euro area were lower than elsewhere. Output volatility in the euro area is much higher when the crisis is included in the sample. But, remarkably, the euro area still scores well on both dimensions compared with other advanced countries. How can we explain this puzzle? How can nominal rigidities plus supply-side pressures not produce bad or worse macroeconomic outcomes?  I believe that the strong anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area is the key to understanding this good economic performance of the euro area. [See the two charts on inflation expectations in the euro area and the US]  Inflation expectations have remained solidly anchored in line with our definition of price stability throughout the crisis. In particular, there was no materialisation of a deflation risk. This has enormously facilitated our task, especially during the period of economic freefall in the winter of 2008/09. Other indicators corroborate the finding that at the aggregate level the real economy of the euro has proved relatively dynamic in comparison with the US: real output per capita has grown at a similar pace in the euro area as in the United States. [See chart on GDP per capita growth in the euro area and the US]  Employment growth in the euro area has also been strong over the past 12 years. More than 14 million jobs have been created since the introduction of the euro, compared with 8 million in the United States. This is not to suggest that there is time for complacency. Unemployment at 9.9% of the labour force remains much too high, and structural reforms are of the essence to make the euro area economy much more flexible and to elevate its growth potential. Finally, public finances in the euro area as a whole are relatively sound. As elsewhere, the financial crisis has left its mark on government deficit and debt in the euro area. Yet, the fiscal deficit in the euro area on aggregate for this year is estimated at less than one half of that in the United States and Japan. One may argue, however that this bird’s eye view is misleading. One common belief is that the US economy is more homogeneous than the economy of the euro area. In other words, aggregate economic data may hide very significant differences in the variance in economic performance across regions within a monetary union.   Economic diversity in the euro area and the United States Looking more closely at the regional dispersion across US regions and euro area economies show that, contrary to what is generally perceived, the dispersion of many of the key indicators is similar. Let us take a look at the inflation indicator. The dispersion of HICP inflation in euro area countries remained broadly stable since the late 1990s, at a level similar to the 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas. During the crisis we saw a temporary increase in inflation dispersion in the euro area. As you can see, this has been reversed over the past 12 months. [See figure on dispersion of annual inflation] The picture is similar for the dispersion of GDP growth. Before the crisis the dispersion of growth rates was around 2%, in both the euro area and the United States. Dispersion rose somewhat during the crisis in both currency areas but remained broadly in line with pre-crisis patterns overall. [1]  [See figure on dispersion of real GDP growth] Let us go one step further and investigate the sources of this growth dispersion in the US and euro area economies. This reveals parallels even in the root causes of dispersion in economic performance. Both currency areas comprise regions that experienced a significant boom and bust cycle over the past decade. Both also contain regions that are facing significant structural challenges of a more long-term nature. Nevada, Arizona, Florida and California in the United States, for example, experienced increases in house prices that outpaced the national average by a wide margin. Steep house price increases and the related strong performance of real estate, construction and financial services probably contributed to above average growth in these states.  Some other US states, particularly the former manufacturing powerhouses in the ''Great Lakes'' region, saw a long episode of below average growth at the same time. Below average performance of the region – and particularly weaker growth rates in the states of Michigan and Ohio – are related to strong reliance on manufacturing. Structural shifts in the US economy towards services have gradually reduced the value added of manufacturing relative to GDP, with implications for areas with a high concentration of companies in manufacturing industries other than information and communications technology. The sharp fall in house prices in Florida and the south-western US states turned boom into bust. These states experienced the harshest recession among the US states. But GDP growth in the ''Great Lakes'' region, which was below average before the crisis, also remained below average during the crisis. Some euro area countries experienced asymmetric boom-and-bust cycles similar to those just described in the United States. Several euro area countries had higher than average growth in the pre-crisis years, while a few have experienced growth below the euro area average for the past decade due to structural issues that could have been tackled with more determination.  The effect of the crisis on the different euro area economies follows a similar pattern to those of comparable US states. The countries in the euro area that have been hit hardest are those in which either large asset-bubble driven imbalances unwound or structural problems were left unaddressed before the crisis. More specifically, Ireland and Greece, in particular, remained in recession in 2010.  Those countries that have yet to implement more far reaching structural reforms also have relatively low growth prospects after the crisis. Just a few years ago, Germany was – entirely wrongly – labelled the “sick man of Europe”. Yet Germany is now an example of how big the dividends of reform can be if structural adjustment is made a strategic priority and implemented with sufficient patience. The relatively low growth rates in some countries are linked to a deterioration of competitiveness, driven, for example, by persistent above average unit labour costs.  Ahead of EMU, unit labour costs converged in the euro area. What is more – disregarding the most recent countries to join the euro area – dispersion both ahead of the crisis and during the crisis was very similar in the euro area and the United States.  [See figure on dispersion of ULC] At the same time, it is worth noting that both currency areas include regions with persistently above or below average growth of unit labour costs. Again leaving aside the most recent countries to join the euro area, here, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, in particular, have lost competitiveness vis-à-vis their main trading partners in the euro area. Germany, in contrast, has been able to lower relative unit labour costs over the same period.  [See fan chart on dispersion of ULC in EA] Similar persistent losses and gains in competitiveness are also observed in the United States. Some states have experienced large or persistent increases in unit labour costs, currently exceeding the national average by as much as 20%. Other states, on the other hand, have been gaining competitiveness vis-à-vis the national average over the past decade. [See fan chart on dispersion of ULC in the US] In summary, these results suggest that those who are questioning the viability of the euro area as a single currency area on the grounds of economic heterogeneity are misguided. Over the past 12 years, this has been broadly similar in the euro area and the United States.  This should, however, be no reason for any complacency in the euro area.  As the crisis has taught us, persistent losses in competitiveness on the part of individual members in a currency union lead to a build-up of external and internal imbalances. When these unravel, the cost for the affected economies can be very large. They can also have spillover effects on other members of the currency union. In any union, an economic governance framework is needed to prevent developments in an individual member state endangering the smooth functioning of the union. But for EMU, the economic governance framework devised in the 1990s has not been implemented and, in any case, has proved too weak during the crisis. The crisis has exposed a clear need for strong reform. As I speak today the reform debate is still in progress, and in the last part of my lecture, I would like to talk briefly about the present reform of economic governance in the euro area.  Economic governance in the euro area The existing economic governance framework has been incorrectly implemented and, more importantly, has proved to be insufficiently binding while lacking appropriate comprehensiveness.  Today’s reform of the governance framework has to take the current constitutional framework. We have to accept this situation as a given, at least for the foreseeable future, even if I am convinced that we have already to reflect upon further steps for economic governance in the longer term. Today, we have to empower the institutional arrangements that are already in place to the point at which they can really and durably inspire confidence.  The requirements for a very significant reinforcement of the fiscal surveillance of the Stability and Growth Pact and for the creation of a new surveillance of competitive indicators and macroeconomic policy have been discussed widely and in much detail.  As you may know, the ECB takes the strong view that there is the need for more speed and automaticity in the sanctioning mechanism, particularly in the Stability and Growth Pact, but also in the broader macroeconomic policy surveillance framework. The experience of the past months has vividly demonstrated the importance of a timely correction of internal and external imbalances. Beyond faster and more automatic sanctions, the enforcement tools also need to be more effective. The macroeconomic surveillance framework, in particular, needs to provide clear incentives by imposing financial sanctions at an early stage. This also means that there should be no room for discretion in the implementation of the surveillance framework.  At the same time, requirements for fiscal and other macroeconomic policies should be more ambitious. To ensure that none of the euro area countries are left behind, they have to bring national policies in line with membership of a currency union. The implementation of sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies is best ensured if these are solidly anchored at the national level. An effective way of achieving this is to implement strong national budgetary frameworks in the euro area Member States.  [See figure on governance reforms] Another important area of reform, at the global level, is the reform of financial governance. I have to say that on financial reform we have made relatively rapid progress at the global and European levels. As you know, we have drawn up a set of more stringent banking regulations, more ambitious capital requirements to absorb losses, improving coverage and reducing the risk of excessive borrowing. The countercyclical capital buffers are designed to reduce pro-cyclicality.  At the same time, the supervision of financial institutions, financial markets and market infrastructure has been tightened, and the organisational structure of financial oversight has been overhauled. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which I chair together with Mervyn King, and the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) – the three new authorities created for the European banking sector, insurance and occupational pensions, and capital markets – have taken up their work at the beginning of this year. The ESRB is in the process of developing the tools necessary to warn and, if appropriate, make recommendations as regards systemic risk. And the ESAs will allow closer monitoring of the interrelationships within the EU’s financial system. But much remains to be done. Most importantly, we need to ensure the full implementation of the envisioned reforms. In addition, key areas where work is still in progress – not only at the European, but also at global level – include: the treatment of systemically important financial institutions; the mechanism of bank crisis management and resolution; oversight of the shadow banking system; and – very importantly – the further regulation and oversight of financial markets and their functioning.  [See figure on financial reforms]  Conclusion  Let me conclude. Europe’s European Union on the one hand and European Economic and Monetary Union on the other hand have always had their critics. For example, as regards EMU, some have argued that a single currency was inappropriate for a continent that is economically more heterogeneous than the United States. And some have claimed that the ECB would not be able to set appropriate interest rates for the euro area to maintain price stability and contribute a positive economic outlook. The evidence I have presented here proves these sceptical views not confirmed. The euro area as a whole has witnessed an unprecedented degree of price stability since its inception more than 12 years ago, including during the crisis. This achievement has been accompanied by economic performance in terms of growth per capita and job creation that compares positively with other large advanced economies.  It is also remarkable that there is convincing evidence that the euro area and the United States have similar features in terms of diversity of the economies that are part of these vast continents: member countries on this side of the Atlantic and the States on the other side. This is documented, in particular, as regards asymmetric inflation, asymmetric growth developments and even in terms of somewhat persistent asymmetric gains and losses of competitiveness.  As I have said, none of this should make us complacent. The sovereign debt crises in three smaller euro area countries underline the urgency of a far-reaching overhaul of the fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance institutions in Europe. Here the governments of the Member States are called on to create the institutions that are commensurate with full economic and monetary union.

       " {'ECB': ['\" I am pleased to speak to a group that has such a distinguished record of identifying crucial issues related to the federal budget and working toward bipartisan solutions to our nation\\'s fiscal problems. Today I will briefly discuss the fiscal challenges the nation faces and the importance of meeting those challenges for our collective economic future. I will then conclude with some thoughts on the way forward.Fiscal Policy Challenges\\nAt about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), the federal budget deficit has widened appreciably since the onset of the recent recession in December 2007. The exceptional increase in the deficit has mostly reflected the automatic cyclical response of revenues and spending to a weak economy as well as the fiscal actions taken to ease the recession and aid the recovery. As the economy continues to expand and stimulus policies are phased out, the budget deficit should narrow over the next few years.Unfortunately, even after economic conditions have returned to normal, the nation faces a sizable structural budget gap. Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget project that the budget deficit will be almost 5 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2015, assuming that current budget policies are extended and the economy is then close to full employment\\\\. Of even greater concern is that longer-run projections that extrapolate current policies and make plausible assumptions about the future evolution of the economy show the structural budget gap increasing significantly further over time. For example, under the alternative fiscal scenario developed by the Congressional Budget Office, which assumes most current policies are extended, the deficit is projected to be about 6-1/2 percent of GDP in 2020 and almost 13 percent of GDP in 2030. The ratio of outstanding federal debt to GDP, expected to be about 69 percent at the end of this fiscal year, would under that scenario rise to 87 percent in 2020 and 146 percent in 2030.2 One reason the debt is projected to increase so quickly is that the larger the debt outstanding, the greater the budgetary cost of making the required interest payments. This dynamic is clearly unsustainable.The nation\\'s long-term fiscal imbalances did not emerge overnight. To a significant extent, they are the result of an aging population and fast-rising health-care costs, both of which have been predicted for decades. The Congressional Budget Office projects that net federal outlays for health-care entitlements--which were 5 percent of GDP in 2010--could rise to more than 8 percent of GDP by 2030. Even though projected fiscal imbalances associated with the Social Security system are smaller than those for federal health programs, they are still significant. Although we have been warned about such developments for many years, the difference is that today those projections are becoming reality.A large and increasing level of government debt relative to national income risks serious economic consequences. Over the longer term, rising federal debt crowds out private capital formation and thus reduces productivity growth. To the extent that increasing debt is financed by borrowing from abroad, a growing share of our future income would be devoted to interest payments on foreign-held federal debt. High levels of debt also impair the ability of policymakers to respond effectively to future economic shocks and other adverse events.Even the prospect of unsustainable deficits has costs, including an increased possibility of a sudden fiscal crisis. As we have seen in a number of countries recently, interest rates can soar quickly if investors lose confidence in the ability of a government to manage its fiscal policy. Although historical experience and economic theory do not show the exact threshold at which the perceived risks associated with the U.S. public debt would increase markedly, we can be sure that, without corrective action, our fiscal trajectory is moving the nation ever closer to that point.Perhaps the most important thing for people to understand about the federal budget is that maintaining the status quo is not an option. Creditors will not lend to a government whose debt, relative to national income, is rising without limit; so, one way or the other, fiscal adjustments sufficient to stabilize the federal budget must occur at some point. These adjustments could take place through a careful and deliberative process that weighs priorities and gives individuals and firms adequate time to adjust to changes in government programs and tax policies. Or the needed fiscal adjustments could come as a rapid and much more painful response to a looming or actual fiscal crisis in an environment of rising interest rates, collapsing confidence and asset values, and a slowing economy. The choice is ours to make.Achieving Fiscal Sustainability\\nThe primary long-term goal for federal budget policy must be achieving fiscal sustainability. A straightforward way to define fiscal sustainability is as a situation in which the ratio of federal debt to national income is stable or moving down over the longer term. This goal can be attained by bringing spending, excluding interest payments, roughly in line with revenues, or in other words, by approximately balancing the primary budget. Given the sharp run-up in debt over the past few years, it would be reasonable to plan for a period of primary budget surpluses, which would serve eventually to bring the ratio of debt to national income back toward pre-recession levels.Fiscal sustainability is a long-run concept. Achieving fiscal sustainability, therefore, requires a long-run plan, one that reduces deficits over an extended period and that, to the fullest extent possible, is credible, practical, and enforceable. In current circumstances, an advantage of taking a longer-term perspective in forming concrete plans for fiscal consolidation is that policymakers can avoid a sudden fiscal contraction that might put the still-fragile recovery at risk. At the same time, acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits would not only enhance economic performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence.While it is crucial to have a federal budget that is sustainable, our fiscal policies should also reflect the nation\\'s priorities by providing the conditions to support ongoing gains in living standards and by striving to be fair both to current and future generations. In addressing our long-term fiscal challenges, we should reform the government\\'s tax policies and spending priorities so that they not only reduce the deficit, but also enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by increasing incentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our workforce, by stimulating private capital formation, by promoting research and development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure. We cannot reasonably expect to grow our way out of our fiscal imbalances, but a more productive economy will ease the tradeoffs that we face.Making Fiscal Plans\\nIt is easy to call for sustainable fiscal policies but much harder to deliver them. The issues are not simply technical; they are also closely tied to our values and priorities as a nation. It is little wonder that the debates have been so intense and progress so difficult to achieve.Recently, negotiations over our long-run fiscal policies have become tied to the issue of raising the statutory limit for federal debt. I fully understand the desire to use the debt limit deadline to force some necessary and difficult fiscal policy adjustments, but the debt limit is the wrong tool for that important job. Failing to raise the debt ceiling in a timely way would be self-defeating if the objective is to chart a course toward a better fiscal situation for our nation.The current level of the debt and near-term borrowing needs reflect spending and revenue choices that have already been approved by the current and previous Congresses and Administrations of both political parties. Failing to raise the debt limit would require the federal government to delay or renege on payments for obligations already entered into. In particular, even a short suspension of payments on principal or interest on the Treasury\\'s debt obligations could cause severe disruptions in financial markets and the payments system, induce ratings downgrades of U.S. government debt, create fundamental doubts about the creditworthiness of the United States, and damage the special role of the dollar and Treasury securities in global markets in the longer term. Interest rates would likely rise, slowing the recovery and, perversely, worsening the deficit problem by increasing required interest payments on the debt for what might well be a protracted period\\\\.ome have suggested that payments by the Treasury could be prioritized to meet principal and interest payments on debt outstanding, thus avoiding a technical default on federal debt. However, even if that were the case, given the current size of the deficit and the uneven time pattern of government receipts and payments, the Treasury would soon find it necessary to prioritize among and withhold critical disbursements, such as Social Security and Medicare payments and funds for the military. Moreover, while debt-related payments might be met in this scenario, the fact that many other government payments would be delayed could still create serious concerns about the safety of Treasury securities among financial market participants. The Hippocratic oath holds that, first, we should do no harm. In debating critical fiscal issues, we should avoid unnecessary actions or threats that risk shaking the confidence of investors in the ability and willingness of the U.S. government to pay its bills.In raising this concern, I am by no means recommending delay or inaction in addressing the nation\\'s long-term fiscal challenges--quite the opposite. I urge the Congress and the Administration to work in good faith to quickly develop and implement a credible plan to achieve long-term sustainability. I hope, though, that such a plan can be achieved in the near term without resorting to brinksmanship or actions that would cast doubt on the creditworthiness of the United States.What would such a plan look like? Clear metrics are important, together with triggers or other mechanisms to establish the credibility of the plan. For example, policymakers could commit to enacting in the near term a clear and specific plan for stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP within the next few years and then subsequently setting that ratio on a downward path. Indeed, such a trajectory for the ratio of debt to GDP is comparable to the one proposed by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform\\\\. To make the framework more explicit, the President and congressional leadership could agree on a definite timetable for reaching decisions about both shorter-term budget adjustments and longer-term changes. Fiscal policymakers could look now to find substantial savings in the 10-year budget window, enforced by well-designed budget rules, while simultaneously undertaking additional reforms to address the long-term sustainability of entitlement programs. Such a framework could include a commitment to make a down payment on fiscal consolidation by enacting legislation to reduce the structural deficit over the next several years.Conclusion\\nThe task of developing and implementing sustainable fiscal policies is daunting, and it will involve many agonizing decisions and difficult tradeoffs. But meeting this challenge in a timely manner is crucial for our nation. History makes clear that failure to put our fiscal house in order will erode the vitality of our economy, reduce the standard of living in the United States, and increase the risk of economic and financial instability. \"'],\n",

       " {'ECB': ['  Risk Management in Central Banking   Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, International Risk Management Conference 2011, Free University of Amsterdam, 15 June 2011  Introduction [1]  It is a pleasure for me to speak at this International Risk Management Conference 2011, and particularly to contribute to this workshop on financial stability. In my remarks today, I would like to elaborate on two interrelated issues, namely financial stability and the risk management function in central banking.  I plan to structure my talk in two parts. First, I will discuss the role of central banks as liquidity providers and lenders of last resort, seeking to preserve financial stability as a necessary, albeit insufficient, condition for achieving their primary objective of price stability. This role will in turn explain why central banks, including of course the Eurosystem and the ECB, have expanded their balance sheets during the crisis. Second, I will elaborate on risk management in central banks, explaining how this differs from risk management practices in private financial firms. In doing so, I will also talk about the risk management framework of the ECB and the Eurosystem and how this contributes to the ECB’s policy goals, among other things, by ensuring the institution’s financial protection. My objective is to provide a better understanding of the specificities of central banking activities in the supply of liquidity to the financial sector. I will also clarify why certain comments that have been made recently about central banks – in particular the ECB - becoming ‘bad banks’, as a result of their actions during the financial crisis, are fundamentally flawed.  1. Central bank as lender of last resort The financial crisis has reminded us how, after a negative liquidity shock, financial firms may be forced to liquidate assets that they hold in stock in order to preserve a cash buffer. This naturally puts downward pressure on the market value of those assets. And when asset values decrease, other financial firms which hold that type of asset in their portfolios may be forced to sell as well to protect their balance sheet and in particular their desired capital ratio. Downward spirals can therefore ensue, which may seriously imperil the financial stability of the entire system.  If risks become systemic, investors collectively try to escape them by scrambling for an ‘outside asset’. When situations arise in which all counterparties appear to be at great risk, the only safe store of value are assets that do not represent a claim on anybody in the market. Liquidity – which is a claim on a central bank – becomes the only asset – outside asset – in demand in these circumstances. Investors hoard liquidity and shed all other financial claims that are vulnerable to credit risk. Such heightened preference for liquidity in a context of diminished confidence in other market participants has consequences not only for the value and liquidity profile of the assets held by private institutions, but also for their funding policies. The liquidity and credit crunch disallow the rollover of liabilities, and therefore investors are pushed to liquidate assets in the market, further contributing to the downward spiral.  It is crucial to realise that even a partial collapse of the financial system would jeopardise the ultimate goal of central banks, i.e. price stability, as prices adjust to a falling real economy. Furthermore, financial instability can negatively impact on monetary policy transmission. For those reasons, under such circumstances central banks have to provide liquidity to the markets, intermediating in the money market with the aim of stabilising the financial sector and avoiding a meltdown. In other words, they have to play the role of ‘lenders of last resort’.  Playing such a role of course has implications for the size and risk profile of central banks’ balance sheets. At times of severe financial stress, central banks have to assume more risk in order to fulfil their mandate of price stability. These are risks that no private player is willing or able to take on. By doing so, a central bank achieves three things: it ensures the adequate transmission of monetary policy impulses; it helps to preserve the liquidity of financial markets; and it ultimately helps to restore a private market for those assets and thus creates the conditions which are necessary for it to unwind those positions.  In other words, the central bank is the only financial institution which – by temporarily taking on more risk than it would do in normal conditions – can manage and keep systemic risk in check.  As far as the Eurosystem is concerned, most liquidity-providing operations are conducted in the form of repo transactions, which are completely collateralised. When a counterparty fails, the central bank does not lose all the funds it has lent. A substantial fraction of value can be recovered from the repo-ed assets. What matters most, repo operations are short-term lending, from one week up to, currently, three months. The short-term nature of these interventions means that they can be – and are being – elastically unwound as market conditions improve. In this respect, the ECB framework allows for an ‘automatic’ contraction in its balance sheet: when favourable conditions are restored, banks can once again lend to each other in the money market. It goes of course without saying that not every action to deal with systemic or banking crises needs to be taken by the central bank. Liquidity support by central banks is meant to provide counterparties with bridge funding to cover the transition to calmer market conditions. It is predicated on the assumption that counterparties are and remain solvent institutions. If the latter condition is not met, then fiscal authorities should step in and, if necessary, inject fresh capital. The measures announced for the Irish banking system are a case in point. In the following I will elaborate in greater detail on the key aspects that enable central banks to take risks in crises. In particular, I will describe some features of risk management in central banks, explaining the main differences with risk management practices in private banks. I will also briefly describe the risk control framework of the ECB, and the Eurosystem in general, which ensures its financial protection while helping to achieve its policy goal.  2. Risk management in a central bank  General remarks Central banks have preferences and constraints that differ from those of private banks. The objectives of central banks are defined in their statutes, which typically specify the maintenance of price stability as their primary mandate.  For central banking policies to be successful, they need to remain credible by making sure that at least two conditions are met. First, a central bank should be sufficiently capitalised and run in such a way that it remains financially independent. Financial independence helps to keep external parties from unduly interfering in the conduct of monetary policy.  Second, the long-term profitability of a central bank needs to be ensured, so that the bank’s reaction to specific economic circumstances is not influenced by considerations of the short-term financial impact of such policies on its profit and loss accounts.  Consequently, the capital position of a central bank, its profitability and the degree of financial risk protection provided by its risk control framework seem to be crucial elements that contribute to its credibility, hence facilitating monetary policy. This consideration, along with the principles of prudence and transparency that are required for all public institutions entrusted with the management of public funds, calls for the establishment of state-of-the-art risk management frameworks and the highest governance standards. Risks taken in central banking activities need to be analysed in a holistic manner, considering the interaction of different portfolios and operations. For that purpose, a state-of-the-art comprehensive risk monitoring and reporting framework is required, capable of providing decision-making bodies with appropriate risk management input. As a key element of the risk management function at a central bank, the highest governance standards need to be observed, both in terms of the reporting lines and organisation of the risk management function.  Making a comparison of central banking practices with the risk management and governance standards required for private financial institutions seems obvious. However, it is not always easy to take best practice in private financial institutions as a measure for comparing the risk management frameworks of central banks, since there are a number of very relevant differences that make such comparisons inappropriate. Those differences relate to the structure and components of the financial statements and their corresponding risks, as well as to the objectives and constraints faced in the strategic asset allocation and other risk management decisions. I will elaborate on the most significant aspects of these dissimilarities.  Liabilities and capital position of central banks To begin with, I will focus on the capital and liability side of the balance sheet, since the most striking idiosyncratic feature of a central bank’s balance sheet is the existence of non-maturing liabilities that are not remunerated. I am referring, of course, to banknotes. A central bank is endowed with the monopoly to issue central bank money, which constitutes a sizeable liability. Furthermore, central banks have also a privileged access to other stable funding sources such as the current accounts covering the minimum reserve requirements. Therefore, in times of financial distress central banks do not face the same liquidity challenges as private institutions.  The solvency profile of central banks also differs significantly from that of private financial institutions. The latter need to weight their risks against the financial buffers provided by their explicit capital position. In the case of the Eurosystem, its explicit capital position is determined by consolidated capital and reserves amounting to more than €80 billion, but also by revaluation accounts amounting to more than €300 billion. Although such explicit financial buffers remain a valid and necessary benchmark to assess the leverage and the risk-taking capacity of central banks, their financial strength cannot be fully captured by using capital adequacy metrics such as those applicable to private banks for regulatory purposes, as it has been done in a rather simplistic way by some commentators. Particularly, the privilege to issue legal tender gives central banks an additional financial buffer in the form of seigniorage income. The concept of seigniorage income refers to the return generated by the assets that are funded with non-remunerated liabilities, that is, with banknotes. The seigniorage income expected for the future constitutes an implicit financial buffer that needs to be considered when assessing the economic capital of a central bank. In this regard, the net present value of such future income can be seen as a sort of ‘franchise capital’, as it reflects the value of the ‘franchise’ to issue legal tender.  Having discussed the different components of the liability side of a central bank, and particularly its capital position, I’d like to consider the use made by central banks of such capital and look at the asset side of the balance sheet.  Assets and risk management framework of central banks Capital allocation in central banking, understood as the risk budgeting and strategic asset allocation decisions that arise from the capital position and objectives of the bank, also differs substantially in methods and scope from that conducted at private financial institutions. On the one hand, regulatory capital requirements are not a constraint for central banks. On the other hand, the risk-return trade-off is not the only relevant function to evaluate the capital allocation decisions of a central bank, since its objective should be to maximise social welfare by achieving its policy goals. Against this background, the risk profile of a central bank displays characteristics that are significantly different from those of private banks. From a dynamic perspective, central banks tend to take more risks in crisis situations, whereas private firms reduce their exposures. From a static perspective, central banks tend to take far less equity risk, duration risk and credit risk than private firms, while taking a much higher currency risk exposure. In addition, strategic decisions in central banks typically are shaped to reduce operational, legal and reputational risks to a minimum, not only to avoid the possible financial impact of those risks, but more importantly, to maintain credibility. I will now turn to the main determinants of the risk profile, on the asset side, of a central bank’s balance sheet, by describing the Eurosystem case, and, in particular, that of the ECB. I’ll consider the applicable risk mitigation measures as well. I will start by describing a central bank’s exposure to exchange rate (or FX) risk. The extent to which central banks hold FX risk in their balance sheets differs substantially from the typically much lower FX exposures of private firms. FX risk is, in normal times, the core determinant of the risk profile of a central bank such as the ECB. Hence, from a risk management perspective, the size of the foreign reserves held, the currency distribution and the degree to which such positions may be hedged are some of the more important choices a central bank has to make. But in fact, these choices are not risk management choices. In the case of the ECB, foreign reserves are mainly held for intervention purposes, and therefore the corresponding FX risk is not hedged. The reason for taking on that apparent risk is simple: a central bank may need to intervene in the markets by selling foreign currency if a sudden appreciation of those currencies impairs price stability or financial stability directly or indirectly. In a sense, the need to intervene represents a contingent policy liability, and by taking such an FX risk we are effectively hedging or matching such contingent liability.  The exposure to gold price movements is also significantly higher in central banks than in private banks. For example, holdings of gold in the Eurosystem amount to approximately €350 billion, accounting for almost 20% of the total assets. The holdings are on this scale not only for historical reasons, but also for risk management reasons, as gold is considered to be a safe haven. In times of financial distress, gold indeed helps central banks to maintain a solid financial position. Another striking difference of central bank exposures compared with those of private institutions is to be found in their investment portfolios. Those of central banks are typically managed with a very high degree of prudence. Risks are kept to levels that ensure the financial buffers of the institution remain free to meet policy needs, while at the same time attempting to achieve sufficient income to cover operating expenses and to ensure long-term profitability. The regular fixed-income portfolios of the ECB, as an example, are managed against internally derived benchmark portfolios which serve as a yardstick for performance and risk measurement. Our benchmarks reflect our quite conservative stance with regard to the interest rate, credit and liquidity risks, and are derived on the basis of the specific objectives for each portfolio. The management of the actual portfolios against those benchmarks is constrained by a number of typical risk control measures, such as relative value-at-risk limits and caps imposed on credit and liquidity risk exposures. All in all, we could describe the investment framework of our regular fixed-income portfolios as conservative. This of course does not come as a surprise. In normal times, we try to retain in our balance sheet ample leeway in terms of risk-taking capacity. This allows us to expand our balance sheet and take more risks in situations where other market participants are deleveraging and reducing their risks. Our additional risk-taking sometimes arises from our regular operations, but in other cases it occurs through non-conventional measures such as outright purchase programmes. I will discuss some risk management aspects of our outright purchase programmes before briefly covering some of the measures associated with our ordinary monetary policy operations. The security purchase programmes initiated by the Eurosystem as a reaction to the financial crisis, that is the Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP) and the Securities Markets Programme (the SMP), have had the clear objective of smoothing out the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The most powerful risk management arguments for accepting the risks entailed by the programmes were that the markets were overpricing the risks associated with the related assets, and that the Eurosystem’s action could contribute to mitigating market concerns. Not being a liquidity-constrained institution, we can act as a buy-side counterparty in markets where sell-offs are taking place, and our investment in those markets can be held to maturity, so that only default risk could impact our profit and loss accounts.  I will now turn to our ordinary market operations, that is, our lending operations. The risk control framework applied to the Eurosystem’s credit operations is designed according to four basic principles: protection, consistency, simplicity and transparency. Protection can be seen as the main objective of the risk control framework, while consistency, simplicity and transparency are needed for the framework to work in an efficient, accountable and predictable manner. In the context of the implementation of the Eurosystem’s credit operations, financial protection is ensured by relying on three lines of defence that can be complemented by discretionary action.  The first line of defence relates to the fact that, in repo operations, as long as our counterparty meets its obligations, we don’t incur any kind of risk related to the collateral. Assets held as collateral only constitute a guarantee, not a direct exposure. Accordingly, related price decreases could only induce Eurosystem losses if those decreases took place after the default of the counterparty. Therefore, by only accepting financially sound counterparties in our credit operations we greatly limit the risks. Financial soundness is a precondition imposed by the Eurosystem on its counterparties to participate in monetary policy operations. The second line of defence in our credit operations is the eligibility requirements we impose for the collateral. Eurosystem credit operations need to be guaranteed by adequate collateral, complying with minimum credit quality thresholds and other legal criteria and operational requirements. The minimum credit quality requirement in general corresponds to a BBB- rating, although in some cases the rules applied may differ. Regarding ABSs, an asset class that many analysts have blamed for being at the core of the financial crisis, the Eurosystem actually requires a minimum AAA rating at issuance. [2] All in all, the eligibility criteria help to protect the Eurosystem, while ensuring that sufficient collateral remains available to our counterparties under any kind of economic scenario, so that monetary policy can be implemented.  The third line of defence relates to other elements of the collateral risk control framework. Margin call policies and risk control measures such as valuation haircuts are applied to mitigate credit, market and liquidation risks related to the collateral assets that need to be sold to cover the exposure of defaulted counterparties.  Another key component of the financial protection of the Eurosystem when performing credit operations is the valuation of collateral assets. In this regard, the Eurosystem is making considerable efforts to maintain state-of-the-art valuation techniques for those assets for which a reliable market price may not be available.  I would like to emphasise that our collateral eligibility and risk control framework is continually reviewed, and the lessons learned from the crisis are obviously being incorporated into it. That being said, it is also relevant to point out that our framework is designed to be applied consistently in both good and bad times. Our creditworthiness allows us to maintain conservative risk control measures, such as haircuts, above market standards in normal times. Counterparties are willing to accept such haircuts because they know we are not going to default on our obligations. In fact, in times of extreme uncertainty and heightened risk aversion, the conditions in private repo markets deteriorate quickly and our operations become more attractive. By not adjusting our risk control framework in a pro-cyclical manner, and therefore by maintaining or even enlarging the collateral available to our counterparties facing greater financial distress, we achieve two policy goals. On the one hand, we facilitate the implementation of a monetary policy stance consistent with the crisis environment. On the other hand, we contribute to restoring the value of certain assets by attributing them a liquidity status that the market would not have permitted.   The Eurosystem risk position: common misunderstandings Let me address en passant two issues that have received attention from some analysts recently. First, some commentators have stated that, since the ECB’s balance sheet is expanding and is allegedly taking on large risks, the ECB may be turning into a ‘bad bank’. [3] This argument is based on a clear misunderstanding of the type of operations conducted by the Eurosystem and of the risk control measures applied to those operations. The description of the risk control measures and of the specificities of the capital position of the ECB that I just provided should help dispel such misunderstanding. The data have actually confirmed that the Eurosystem’s financial results have proved resilient to the global financial crisis, and its total capital position has even increased. [4] The numbers I have provided in terms of overall capital and reserves of the Eurosystem should help a better understanding of the situation. Second, some analysts have tried to show that the Eurosystem had taken on too much risk, at the detriment of the ECB major shareholder, by looking at the net balances of individual national central banks in the Eurosystem – the so-called TARGET2 balances. [5] Not only is the analysis wrong, as it has been shown by others, [6] but the conclusions in terms of burden sharing are exactly the opposite. In fact, the risk sharing system inherent in the Eurosystem monetary policy operations, which is generally based on the share of GDP and population, is particularly favourable for those countries whose banking system has a comparatively large net creditor position with respect to the rest of the euro area.  I will not elaborate too much on this issue. I will only mention that items related to TARGET2 in the balance sheets of national central banks across the Eurosystem are a natural consequence of the de-centralised provision of credit to banks in the euro area. TARGET2 balances of central banks enable booking cross-border payments and are as such automatic reflections of short-term cross-border base money movements. It is thus misleading to present those balances as a sort of ‘stealth bail-out’ from some national central banks to particular euro area countries.  The size of TARGET2 net balances of an individual central bank is not a one-to-one counterpart of the cumulated current account imbalance of the respective country. Several other factors, such as the degree of integration of the euro area money market and capital market flows play an even larger role. Furthermore, positive net TARGET2 balances represent claims against the Eurosystem as a whole, not bilateral claims against other national central banks. Finally, the claim that Eurosystem operations entail base money flowing out of creditor countries to refinance euro area periphery banking systems is unsubstantiated. The supply of credit in the euro area, like almost everywhere in the world, is determined by the decisions of commercial banks and there is no reason to assume that domestic banks creditor countries are subject to any base money constraint, given their permanent access to Eurosystem operations, especially when these are conducted through fixed-rate full-allotment tenders.   Conclusion During the financial crisis central banks have intervened swiftly to protect financial stability, which is a key precondition to achieve price stability. While this function has now been widely recognised, some concerns have been voiced that central banks have taken on too many risks in their balance sheets.  The point that I wanted to make today is that taking on more risk in times of distress is inherent in the financial stability function of central banks. The central bank is the only patient investors who can intervene at times of crisis as a counterpart to distressed short term investors with a view to ensuring market liquidity and restoring confidence. However, this can happen only if the financial independence of the central bank is safeguarded, otherwise the credibility of its monetary policy aimed at ensuring price stability may be jeopardised. This is why central banks manage their risks, albeit not necessarily in the same way as private financial institutions because of the fundamental differences which exist between the two.  Hopefully these differences are now better understood, and misperceptions about the role of central banks corrected. Thank you for your attention.

       " {'ECB': [\"  Economic diversity on both sides of the Atlantic   Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the US Sciences Po Foundation Annual Benefit in New York on 16 June 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to speak to you here tonight.  The past few years have been a testing time for the economies of both the United States and Europe. We were faced with the worst financial and economic crisis since the Second World War. Still today – on both sides of the Atlantic – we are dealing with the consequences of the crisis – for economic growth, for employment and for government finances.  The crisis has also exposed the United States and Europe to a number of asymmetric shocks – in which different parts of our economies have had a wide diversity of experience. Some countries within the euro area are the particular focus of market attention at the moment as a result of their sovereign debt issues. Some observers have been wondering how diversity can be dealt with in Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), what it means for monetary policy and whether the variations in economic conditions are aggravated by product and labour market rigidities. It has often been argued that economic diversity or heterogeneity is very significantly larger in Europe than in the United States.  We at the European Central Bank (ECB) have been looking closely at the degree of diversity in the two large, continental advanced economies on either side of the Atlantic. And some of the findings from this comparison are quite interesting. Because they show that economic diversity within the two currency areas is very similar in many ways. The analysis also shows that, in fact, in a large number of respects the two economies are similarly diverse.  I would like to share some of the key insights of this analysis with you tonight.  I. Economic diversity in the euro area and the United States The United States and Europe are often compared. This is quite natural. Americans and Europeans share a common cultural legacy. But our two economies, and I am speaking here of the economy of the euro area on our side, are also similar. Both are of similar size, in terms of population and in terms of economic output. Both have closely integrated financial and product markets. And both have a single currency. Let me begin my comparison with an economic indicator that is particularly close to a central banker’s heart: inflation. In historical terms, overall inflation has been low and stable in both the United States and the euro area since the late 1990s.  The ECB aims at an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Since the inception of the euro, the ECB has achieved that objective. Annual inflation in the euro area has been 1.97% on average over the first 12 years. Importantly, the standard deviation in inflation across the members of the euro area has been around 1%. And it has remained broadly stable at similar levels to those observed in the US Metropolitan Statistical Areas. From that standpoint prices in the euro area are broadly homogenous and similar to those in the United States.  My second point of comparison is how diverse the United States and the euro area are in terms of economic growth. The results here are similar to that for inflation. First of all, the overall growth rates over the first twelve years of the euro were actually quite similar in the euro area to those in the US, once you adjust for differences in population growth. In both the euro area and the US, per capita growth was about 1% during 1999-2010. As concerns dispersion within the economies, before the crisis, the standard deviation of growth rates was around 2% in both the euro area and the United States. Dispersion rose somewhat during the crisis in both currency areas but remained broadly in line with pre-crisis patterns. [1]  Allow me to go one step further and compare the sources of this growth dispersion in the United States and the euro area. Both currency areas include regions that experienced a significant boom-and-bust cycle over the past decade. Both also contain regions that are facing significant structural challenges of a more long-term nature. Let me start off with the United States. Here, several states experienced increases in house prices that outpaced the national average by a wide margin. The steep house price increases probably contributed to above average growth in these states, owing to strong positive contributions from real estate, construction and financial services.  Nevada, Arizona, Florida and California are good examples, where average growth between 1998 and 2006 exceeded that of most other states. The sharp fall in house prices in recent years turned boom into bust. These states experienced the harshest recession among the US states.  At the same time, some other US states have seen a long period of below average growth, particularly the former manufacturing powerhouses in the ''Great Lakes'' region. Structural shifts in the US economy towards services have gradually reduced the value added of manufacturing relative to GDP. In the decade before the financial crisis, growth rates in states with a high concentration of companies in manufacturing industries other than information and communications technology, such as Michigan and Ohio, were lower than in most other US states. Unsurprisingly, GDP growth in these regions remained below average during the crisis. The euro area also contains examples of these two types of regions. On the one hand, some countries experienced asymmetric boom-and-bust cycles. Several euro area countries had higher than average growth in the pre-crisis years. For example, up to 2006, growth in Ireland was higher than in most other euro area economies, owing much to large increases in house prices.  On the other hand, a few euro area countries – Portugal for example – experienced growth below the euro area average in the decade preceding the crisis. This was typically a consequence of structural issues that could have been tackled earlier and with more determination.  Just a few years ago, this group of countries included Germany, then labelled completely wrongly the “sick man of Europe”. Yet Germany is now an example of how big the dividends of reform can be if structural adjustment is made a strategic priority and implemented with sufficient patience. In short, the effects of the crisis on the different economies in the euro area follow a similar pattern to those in the United States. The countries in the euro area that have been hit hardest are those in which either large asset-bubble driven imbalances unwound or structural problems were left unaddressed before the crisis. More specifically, Ireland and Greece, in particular, remained in recession in 2010.  Those countries that have yet to implement more far reaching structural reforms also have relatively low growth prospects after the crisis. These relatively low growth rates are linked to a deterioration of competitiveness, driven by persistent losses in relative competitiveness, for example by above average increases in relative labour costs. Again, this problem is not isolated to the euro area. Disregarding the most recent countries to join the euro area, dispersion of unit labour costs is similar in the euro area and the United States, both before and during the crisis.  It is worth noting that both currency areas include regions with persistently above or below average unit labour cost growth. Again leaving aside the most recent countries to join the euro area, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, in particular, have lost competitiveness vis-à-vis their main trading partners in the euro area. Germany, in contrast, has been able to lower relative unit labour costs.  There have been similar persistent losses and gains in competitiveness in the United States. Some states have experienced large or persistent increases in unit labour costs, currently exceeding the national average by as much as 20%. Other states have been gaining competitiveness vis-à-vis the national average over the past decade. In summary, economic heterogeneity in the euro area and the United States has been broadly similar on a number of measures over the past 12 years.   II. Economic governance in the euro area But the crisis has shown us that this should be no reason for any complacency in the euro area. Persistent losses in competitiveness on the part of individual members in a currency union lead to a build-up of external and internal imbalances. When these unravel, the cost for the affected economies can be large. They can also have spillover effects on other members of the currency union. In any union, an economic governance framework is needed to prevent developments in an individual member state endangering the smooth functioning of the union. This is particularly true in a currency union that – in contrast to the United States – does not have a large federal budget to balance severe asymmetric developments. For EMU, the economic governance framework devised in the 1990s has not been correctly implemented and, in any case, has proved too weak during the crisis.  As I speak today, the reform debate is still in progress. Allow me to take a few more minutes to outline the reforms required to make Europe’s institutions of economic governance commensurate with monetary union. As you may know, the ECB takes the strong view that there is the need for more speed and automaticity in the sanctioning mechanism. This is particularly true for the Stability and Growth Pact, the EU’s framework for fiscal governance. But it is also the case for the broader framework for macroeconomic policy surveillance. The experience of recent months has vividly demonstrated the importance of a timely correction of internal and external imbalances. But faster and more automatic sanctions alone will not be enough. The enforcement tools will also need to be made more effective. The macroeconomic surveillance framework, in particular, needs to provide clear incentives for sound policies in the member states by imposing financial sanctions at an early stage. This also means that there should be no room for discretion in the implementation of the surveillance framework.  At the same time, requirements on fiscal and other macroeconomic policies should be more ambitious. To ensure that none of the euro area members are left behind, they have to bring national policies in line with membership of a currency union. Finally, the implementation of sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies is best ensured if these are solidly anchored at the national level. An effective way of achieving this is to implement strong national budgetary frameworks in the members of the euro area.   III. Conclusion  Let me conclude. The European Union and the Euro area on one side of the Atlantic, the United States on the other side not only share the common heritage of their culture and their nature of advanced economies. They are not only of similar size. Our economies are also showing remarkable resemblance in their diversity – among the 50 states on this side of the Atlantic and among the 17 euro area members on the other side. This is true for both the euro area and the United States before the crisis and also in their reaction to the asymmetric shocks during the crisis.  Therefore we have a common challenge. That of governing, in the best fashion possible, very large and similarly diversified economies as regards the economic features of member countries and states. This is naturally done in the US through the federal institutional framework.  We Europeans need to reform our economic governance framework, as I have briefly outlined here tonight. Here, we would do well to heed the words of Alexander Hamilton, a founding father of America’s economic and political union,. Just as Hamilton once called to his fellow Americans, we Europeans should call on our leaders to “learn to think (more) continentally”. Thank you for your attention.

       "  'FED': ['  Social Business and Economic Growth   Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Executive Summit on Ethics for the Business World, Vatican City, 16 June 2011 It is my pleasure to be able to speak at this conference on business ethics in contemporary society and to present a central banker’s perspective.  Economic analysis illustrates that the maximisation of the general welfare of a society does not correspond to the sum of each individual’s utility functions, particularly because negative externalities can arise from individuals’ behaviour. This is why a society must put rules and institutions in place, whose objective is to minimise such externalities. One might ask whether the same applies to the area of ethics. In other words, one can ask whether it is enough that individual actors follow shared ethical principles, in particular in the field of business, in order to find an ethical balance that is sustainable at the social level.  I would like to begin by looking at the key factors that triggered the financial crisis, in particular in the United States. Put briefly, the main cause of the crisis was excessive credit demand from households, especially less affluent ones. This demand was, for the large part, indulged and encouraged by the financial system, which had developed sophisticated techniques \\xad– albeit not always transparent – to streamline, manage and distribute risk in an environment in which there had been a general easing of regulation, as requested by actors and granted by the political system. This excessive debt created a speculative bubble, which, after bursting, initiated a chain of repercussions on the financial system and the real economy. The responsibility for this is widespread and systemic. It is so widespread that it is possible, one way or another, to justify each contributing element, including in terms of individual behaviour. Every family dreams of buying a home in order to improve living conditions and to integrate into American society. Even if many households knew that they were taking excessive risk by spending beyond their means, they trusted in the future increase in the value of the property they had purchased, which they had inferred based on the trend of the preceding years. Borrowing – even in difficult periods – in order to buy a home, send the children to a better university, maintain one’s standard of living: this was no different from what entire generations of Americans had been doing for decades. This was the “American dream”.  Looking at the problem from the perspective of the financial markets and individual market participants, the deregulation of the system in order to “democratise” credit and make it available even to the weaker members of society was an objective shared by all political actors in the 1990s and 2000s. It was considered the task of the financial institutions to develop new instruments, including the more sophisticated ones, to support the economic system. Shareholder dividends were considered an objective benchmark for measuring value and the quest for ever increasing dividends the best way to improve the efficiency of the system.  From a political perspective, the growth of the financial and housing sectors is beneficial for economic growth and contributes to the country’s public finances. The deregulation measures – which aimed to enable the less wealthy to purchase houses and to facilitate the functioning of the financial system, and which consequently made an ever increasing contribution to the public purse – seemed to be fully justified. In short, excluding a few specific cases (such as Maddoff for example), it is difficult to support the idea that the large majority of actions that ultimately created the imbalances at the core of the financial crisis were not in line with the legislation and shared ethics held by society at that time. Even the generous bonuses awarded to investment bankers, today frowned upon, were considered prior to the crisis to be an appropriate reward for a complex and specialised profession which attracted the top university students.  Something was clearly wrong. Expectations of a continuous improvement in living standards – on which the growth in credit demand from US households was based – were not sustainable because technological changes and the process of globalisation permanently changed the growth potential of advanced economies. The belief that growth would continue in recent years at a similar pace to that seen in the past was the fruit of a collective illusion. A similar illusion was widespread in financial markets, where the quest for ever higher returns in a context of asymmetric information prompted borrowers and lenders to underestimate risk and to become overleveraged. Attracted by the short-term benefits in terms of higher economic growth and fiscal consolidation, politicians attached less importance to the long-term risks associated with excessive private sector borrowing. Reliance on self-regulation, fuelled in addition by the academic world, led to the public authorities relinquishing responsibility.  Nevertheless, this was not the first financial crisis. We know, and experience confirms this, that targeted prudential rules are necessary to counteract pro-cyclical behaviour and externalities in the financial system. Financial regulation must therefore be strengthened, reversing the tendency that emerged in the years leading up to the crisis for the effectiveness of the rules to be reduced. We also know, however, that one of the objectives of the financial system is to continually innovate in order to create new instruments to manage risk or to increase returns. Those engaged in financial activities tend to find a way around regulation in order to “beat the market”. In a dynamic environment like that of the financial markets, the simple application of the rules is not enough to minimise the externalities that result from the pursuit of individual interests and to reduce the risks of unstable dynamics. Let me give you an example. The development of sophisticated instruments, such as credit default swaps (CDSs), helps to better safeguard against certain risks and to propagate the use of certain financial instruments. It is easier to invest in a government bond from a risky country if it is possible to get protection against the risk of insolvency. CDSs therefore increased the liquidity of the market to the advantage of both the issuer and the investor. CDSs can be purchased even without holding the underlying bond. This means being able to safeguard against the risk of default by a company, a bank or a country, even without having invested in them. This creates an incentive to bet on the failure of companies, banks or entire countries. When the number of market participants using such instruments increases, in the short run ceteris paribus premia rise, signalling an increase in the possibility of default and, in turn, sparking greater demand.  In the summer of 2008, for example, shortly before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers as well as in the weeks following, each financial market participant tried to survive the market collapse through speculative operations which essentially consisted of bets on the failure of other market participants that were in difficulty. This created a spiral effect that contributed to the worsening of the crisis.  In short, in today’s markets, you not only decide which financial activities to invest in, but also which ones to invest “against”. Moreover, the probability of success depends on the capacity to mobilise other forces in the same counteractive direction in order to induce the price of the bond to fall until bankruptcy is declared. It is therefore no surprise that key investment companies make public their opinions on the quality of various types of investment, perhaps with the intention of encouraging others to do the same.  The fight to survive, which in a capitalist system should reward the company with the best product, is changing in nature. Particularly in a period of economic difficulty, when returns are limited, those who survive are those who bet on the failure of others and who manage to convince the market that such a failure is inevitable. It is no longer about Schumpeter’s “creative destruction”, but “destructive destruction”, where the one who survives is the one who bets, rather than the one who innovates and produces. The same is true for countries, on which one can bet and cash in the premium in the event of default. The probability of collecting the premium is greater, the more there are who bet against the country. Default by a country brings economic depression, with severe consequences for society and the democratic structure.  This system creates incentives to behave in a manner that is not in line with the set of ethics on which the capitalist market system is based. It is no longer (only) about concentrating on one’s own activities and seeking to perform better than the others, but (also) about identifying the weaknesses of others, betting on them, and convincing others to do the same in order to bring about their collapse. Whether the recessionary impact is systemic matters little, since the cost, for the most part, will be dumped onto taxpayers.  How can these destabilising market dynamics and their devastating effects on the real economy be thwarted? As I mentioned earlier, simply applying the rules is not enough, since in the majority of cases the rules are backwards-looking and are thus not in a position to regulate behaviour and innovative instruments. Moreover, the rules are largely designed to regulate market phases of relative stability and not exceptional circumstances which necessitate the ability to carry out discretionary interventions. Individual ethics is an important discipline, but it is a discipline that is based on the principle of self-regulation. Particularly in phases of market turbulence, market participants that are not in a position to achieve higher returns than others, or to minimise their losses, are at risk of being pushed out. If the majority of market participants intensively use destabilising financial instruments, those who do not, risk failure.  The role of the regulators, such as the central banks, is thus essential. They have a medium-term perspective and the capacity to intervene autonomously to amend the rules, or to suspend those in force, in order to combat the short-term, pro-cyclical behaviour of market participants and to dampen the destabilising consequences. In order to be able to do this and to be able to act in the face of pressure from those who benefit from the absence of rules in the short term, independence and autonomy are key. There is a wealth of literature on the independence of public institutions, particularly those called on to regulate financial markets and safeguard the value of money, such as central banks. It seems appropriate to recall some of the characteristics of independence because they are closely related to certain fundamental ethical values. It is no coincidence that central bankers have adopted Saint Thomas More as their patron saint, who, with his independence of thought and his firm conviction in the supremacy of the public interest, managed to resist pressure from King Henry VIII – for whom he was the closest adviser prior to being appointed Lord Chancellor – until he was forced to resign, imprisoned and then condemned to death.  On this subject, I would like to quote from Pope Benedict XVI’s speech, given in Westminster Hall in September 2010:  “I recall the figure of Saint Thomas More, the great English scholar and statesman, who is admired by believers and non-believers alike for the integrity with which he followed his conscience, even at the cost of displeasing the sovereign whose “good servant” he was, because he chose to serve God first.”  It may seem bold to compare a central bank to the Church, but that is precisely what Heinrich Mussinghoff, Bishop of Aachen, did two weeks ago today in his address on the occasion of the awarding of the Charlemagne Prize to Jean-Claude Trichet:   “Financial matters have an element of public service. This also applies to the euro, which is helping to realise a shared vision of a united Europe in the spirit of humanism. It is in this spirit that the European Central Bank […] and we members of the Church must fulfil our shared task for the people of this continent and beyond.”  Fortunately, central bank independence no longer depends on the heroic actions of its exponents. In Europe, the Maastricht Treaty provides for and safeguards the independence of the ECB and the national central banks, which together form the Eurosystem. At the start of monetary union, the euro area countries brought the regulations governing their own central banks into line with the Treaty. Subsequent amendments also underwent close inspection by the ECB to ensure their compliance with the Treaty. There is now a laid-down set of principles for assessing central bank independence according to four key criteria:   functional independence, which requires the setting of a clear objective – price stability – and making available the appropriate instruments in order to achieve it;   institutional independence, which prohibits the decision-making bodies of the central bank from seeking or taking instructions from other bodies or governments and prohibits the latter from seeking to influence the decisions of the central bank;   personal independence, which ensures the security of tenure of the members of the decision-making bodies for the whole term of office (eight years in the ECB’s case and a minimum of five years for the national central banks) and safeguards against their arbitrary dismissal;    financial independence, which allows the central bank to have access to sufficient financial resources to carry out its mandate.   These criteria have been key in safeguarding the central banks from attempts to influence their actions, including during the crisis. Indeed, it is sorely tempting to offload onto monetary policy the burden of intervention in fields that are the responsibility of the fiscal authorities, such as budgetary support for countries in difficulty. The ongoing debate about the Greek adjustment programme and ways in which the private sector can be involved in the financing of the country shows how, even in a context where there is a tradition of respect for the autonomy of the central banks, it is possible for the temptation to monetarily finance the government budget to resurface. Asking the ECB, as has been the case recently, to extend the maturities of the government bonds it holds or to accept as collateral bonds from a state that is considered to have defaulted for the re-financing operations of the banking system is a violation of the principle prohibiting the central bank from monetarily financing the treasury, a prohibition explicitly laid down in the Treaty. Any pressure whatsoever of this kind flouts the regulations on independence that protect the ECB. In advanced societies, which are based on sophisticated financial systems, the sum of optimised individual behaviour does not necessarily lead to greater collective prosperity. The ethic of individual responsibility is insufficient. We need to construct an institutional order that better aligns the incentives of individuals, which are oriented primarily towards the short term, with the collective well-being in the medium to long term, and which also takes account of the interests of future generations. Ethical considerations do not only apply, therefore, to individuals, but also apply collectively and to the institutions that represent the continuity of collective interests, beyond the short-term political cycle. The European Union has recently taken important steps in this direction, such as the strengthening of the fiscal rules provided for by the new European economic governance structure and the creation of new supervisory authorities. The experience drawn from this crisis can serve to strengthen our institutions, which are the basis for a fairer society and a revival of trust. I would like to conclude with the words of Bishop Mussinghoff from 2 June this year:  “The ECB was able to create a climate of trust, even in difficult times, and has contributed to the realisation of this great European vision… Joining together with those who share our humanist vision of Europe encourages us in this direction. Together we will win back trust, because trust conquers.”   ']},\n",
       " {'ECB': ['  The euro area and its role in the global economy   Remarks by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, upon reception of the 2011 Global Economy Prize, Kiel, 19 June 2011 It is a privilege to receive this Global Prize today. I would like to thank the jury for this distinction, which honours the ECB and its staff. Kiel has a long tradition of openness. It has forged close ties with the rest of the world, ever since it joined the Hanseatic League in 1283. Seven centuries later, Kiel is today part of the euro area, a vast economic continent, which is itself globally open and linked in many ways to the rest of the world. It is about the euro area and of its role in the global economy that I would like to share with you some thoughts in receiving this Prize today. How can we characterize the salient features of the euro area and of its role in the global economy? And what are the challenges that need to be addressed in this context? Three key aspects deserve attention in my view.  First, the euro area is amongst the most open of large economies in the world. The euro area’s trade relations with the rest of the world have grown appreciably since 1999, which underscores that the euro area is not a closed shop. The euro area’s trade openness has increased by about 9 percentage points over the first years of the euro, from roughly one-quarter to one-third of output, notably as a result of rapidly growing trade with vibrant economies, such as the new EU Member States or China. The euro area is the world’s largest trading partner, after the European Union itself, accounting for about 14% of global exports and imports in 2010. Economic and Monetary Union has fostered trade. Not only inside the euro area (+50% increase in trade volumes over the first years of the euro), but even more so with the European Union as a whole and the rest of the world (+80% over the same period). The euro area is also very open financially, and increasingly so. Its international assets and liabilities averaged each around 170% of GDP in 2009, compared with roughly 140% of GDP for the US and 90% of GDP for Japan. As financial globalisation unfolded in the last decade, the euro area’s external assets and liabilities have grown in tandem, by roughly 80 percentage points of GDP between 1999 and 2009. The euro area is a vast continent of more than 331 million citizens. By population size, it is comparable with the other large economiy of the developed world, namely the United States, with a population of 310 million. In terms of economic output, the euro area is second only to the United States. It accounted for about 20% of world output in 2010, twice the share of Japan (about 10% of world output), and somewhat less than the United States (about one-quarter of world output).   Second, the euro is a stable and credible currency. For over 12 years now, the European Central Bank –together with all national central banks– has been delivering what it is expected to deliver: price stability in the euro area as a whole over the medium-term, with an average annual inflation of less than 2%, but close to 2%. Since we are in Kiel, let me add that in Germany the average yearly inflation has been 1.5%, which is a better result than for any such 12 year period over the last 50 years. We have thereby been safeguarding the euro’s purchasing power. This has been achieved despite several headwinds to the European economy: oil prices went up; the internet bubble burst; violence and wars have raged in some parts of the world; and starting in mid-2007 we had to cope with the most severe global financial crisis in over 60 years. Taken as a whole, the euro area performed soundly also when looking at other macroeconomic indicators, or comparing with other large developed economies.   Adjusted for differences in population growth, per capita GDP growth in the euro area over the last decade has been almost the same as in the United States, at about 1% per year.   The dispersion of real GDP growth rates across euro area countries is comparable with the equivalent dispersion across U.S. states. For instance, the difference between the fastest and slowest-growing U.S. states is not of a markedly different order of magnitude as that between euro area countries.    Overall employment in the euro area increased by 14 million during the first twelve years, compared with a rise of about 8 million in the United States.   And the overall yearly public finance deficit in the euro area is presently about half that in the United States or in Japan. The IMF projects indeed the euro area’s fiscal deficit to reach 4.4% of GDP this year, against 10.8% of GDP in the U.S. and 10.0% in Japan.   The euro’s international status is the outcome of market forces. But one of the particular characteristics of the euro’s international role is to be markedly regional and strongest in economies with close geographical and institutional links to the euro area. The euro’s international role also displays a high degree of stability. And the available factual evidence suggests that it has remained broadly unchanged since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, in particular. For instance, the euro accounted in 2010 for about one-quarter of disclosed foreign exchange reserves globally (against around 60% for the US dollar and 4% for the yen). It also accounted for about one-quarter of the stock of international debt securities and for roughly 20% of foreign exchange turnover.  Third, the euro area has a balanced current account.  As such, the euro area does not contribute to global imbalances, one of the main challenges facing the global economy and the world community. It is worth stressing that the euro area is the relevant dimension to consider for a vast single currency and economic area with a common exchange rate and monetary policy. And there, the numbers are clear: the euro area current account balance averaged less than 0.1% of GDP over 2005-2007 before the global crisis broke out, according to IMF figures. Moreover, the euro area current account is still projected by the Fund to be broadly balanced this year and the next up to 2015. The picture is very different in other parts of the world.  A concern is that after some partial reduction induced by the crisis, global imbalances are starting to widen again. This raises challenges for international monetary and financial cooperation. The euro area has a significant stake in effective global re-balancing, notably through sounder domestic policies worldwide which, in turn, would contribute to global external stability. The global economy has a lot of homework to do if it is to address these challenges. People of goodwill, inspired by the desire to keep the global economy “open, market-based, just and protective” will surely be needed to that end. Credit should therefore be given to initiatives such as the Global Economy Prize to encourage them to press ahead in that direction.  '],\n",
       "  'FED': ['  Intervention at Sveriges Riksbank Conference: Monetary Policy in an Era of Fiscal Stress   Intervention in the panel: Challenges for Monetary and Fiscal Policy, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Stockholm, 17 June 2011 It is a pleasure for me to contribute to this Sveriges Riksbank conference entitled “Monetary Policy in an Era of Fiscal Stress”. The subject is indeed a very topical – and global – one. Not just in Europe but around the world, the crisis has progressively acquired a fiscal dimension that may be with us for a number of years to come.  Against this background, it may be useful for me to briefly look back over the relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policies, stressing in particular the challenges that monetary policy may face in an environment of sharply rising fiscal deficits and debt. Coming from the ECB, I will of course primarily focus on the euro area experience and lessons. If, in a simple one-country setting, sovereign debt becomes unsustainable, the central bank always retains the option – in theory and partly in practice – to monetise the debt. The short-term implication of such monetisation is that sovereign credit risk will be replaced by both an inflation and exchange rate risk. In other words, the currency of that country will no longer be considered as a good store of value, either domestically or externally. None of the above constitutes a feasible scenario for the euro area, which is characterised by a unique combination of centralised monetary policy-making and largely decentralised, albeit closely coordinated, fiscal policy-making. This one-monetary-policy-and-many- fiscal-policies approach is at the heart of the institutional arrangement which governs the interactions between monetary and fiscal policies in the euro area. Importantly, the Treaty specifically excludes any “fiscal dominance of last resort”, due to the prohibition of monetary financing.  So what are the implications of all this?  Ruling out the possibility of monetising sovereign debt in turn rules out inflation and exchange rate risks. However, if we exclude the possibility of monetising the debt and of bailouts between countries, the risk of sovereign default could arise. Furthermore, this type of risk may emerge in financial markets in a rather disruptive way, at least compared with other risks, such as inflation and exchange rate risks. The reason is twofold. First, inflation risk may take time to materialise and to be factored in, even when the central bank monetises the debt. Second, financial markets may find it easier to manage and hedge against inflation and currency risk than against sovereign risk.  The separation between monetary and fiscal policies may create non-linearities and even multiple equilibria in the pricing of credit risk, which in turn may fuel self-fulfilling expectations and precipitate crises. Given the role that government bonds play in advanced economies’ financial markets, such instability may impair the transmission of monetary policy. This may justify targeted action by a central bank to push markets towards a more stable equilibrium. In general, the lack of fiscal dominance and the exposure to sovereign risk should promote overall better fiscal policies. This is certainly the case for most of the euro area countries. Fiscal consolidation started already in 2010, when the euro area general government deficit-to-GDP ratio and the debt-to-GDP ratio reached around 6% and 85% respectively. This compares with a deficit of 11.2% and a debt of 92% in the US, a deficit of 9.5% and a debt of 220.3% in Japan, a deficit of 10.4% in the UK and a debt of 80%. Further improvements in the fiscal situation of all the euro area members is expected for the current year, with the euro area average coming down to slightly above 4%. The euro area debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to stabilise in 2013 and come down thereafter. In the euro area three countries are facing severe problems regarding market access. Overall these three countries account for about 6% of the euro area GDP. I will not elaborate on these three cases, and the fact that they have emerged in the midst of the worst economic and financial crisis since World War II.  The solution to these three cases entails a specific role to be played by the fiscal authority of the respective countries, the fiscal authorities of the other countries supporting the adjustment programme in those countries and the ECB. Some commentators have said that in a crisis stronger coordination between monetary and fiscal policy is desirable, even if it comes at the expense of reducing the independence of monetary policy. The opposite is actually true. Especially in a crisis the responsibilities for monetary policy and for fiscal policy have to remain quite separate.  The reason is that it is precisely during a crisis that the fiscal authorities try to push the central bank towards solving the fiscal problem through the inflation tax. However, the central bank is protected from this pressure by its statutes and the rules it adopts for the conduct of monetary policy. In the case of the ECB, the rules specify that it can lend only to sound institutions and against appropriate collateral. The appropriateness of the collateral depends in particular on whether the country under stress follows rigorously the IMF/EU adjustment programme and is on track to regain market access. The soundness of institutions, which is assessed primarily by supervisors, is also a key principle. It has ensured that all adjustment programmes envisaged sufficient funds for the recapitalization of the banking system.  These rules and principles apply to the central bank but are ultimately there to protect taxpayers and to prevent monetary policy from being misused to bail out insolvent governments. They constrain the actions of the central bank, but also give it sufficient flexibility to react in the event of a crisis.  There is no doubt that these rules cause some frustration to those who would instead like to shift the responsibility for solving the crisis entirely to the central bank, even if the crisis is of fiscal origin. It is quite paradoxical that the very same people who criticise the ECB for having taken too many risks during the financial crisis are also those who criticise it for opposing any form of debt restructuring. This same group even suggests that the ECB should stand ready to accept, after a debt restructuring, the signature of a default-rated government as collateral. How are such contradictions possible? In my view they are only possible when the analysis is partial or the rationale is unclear. Let me give a couple of examples. One reason for debt restructuring – which is often made by some theoretical economists – is that it helps financial markets to function better and it eliminates moral hazard. The problem with this view is that it totally omits the broader impact on the markets. Trying to eliminate moral hazard in the middle of a systemic crisis is like shooting yourself in the foot. Think about it: did the failure of Lehman Brothers make markets work better, or worse? Did it reduce moral hazard?  Another reason for private sector involvement (PSI) is to minimise the taxpayer’s contribution and to penalise bad investments. This reason is even less economically sound. Lehman Brothers’ failure proved that if PSI is applied in the wrong way, the taxpayer will in the end pay more. Short-term speculative investors benefit from perverse forms of PSI, while long term investors are punished. That doesn’t sound very clever to me. Having a clear objective, which in the case of the ECB is price stability, helps us to be consistent and to implement a policy which is in the best interests of taxpayers, given that inflation is ultimately a tax.  The architecture of the euro area – which clearly divides responsibilities between the single monetary policy and the many national fiscal policies – offers strong protection for taxpayers: the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact are intended to ensure sound fiscal policies and to guarantee the independence of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy.  Some strengthening of the institutional framework underlying the Stability and Growth Pact is needed in order to avoid any repetition of the problems we are currently experiencing. Progress has been achieved, although not as much as we would have hoped. However, looking back, it is encouraging to note that, when facing difficult choices, the political authorities of the euro area have always decided to move forward, towards greater integration and a more solid foundation for Economic and Monetary Union. The trialogue between the Commission, Council and European Parliament has tried to finalize an agreement on the strengthening of fiscal discipline in the euro area, in time for next week’s ECOFIN Council and European Parliament plenary meetings. The Parliament is asking for a reverse Qualified Majority in the Council to vote down a Commission recommendation to a Member State with clearly unsound budgetary policy already under the preventive arm of the Pact. This should not be seen by the Member States as a reduction of their sovereignty but rather as a way to better protect themselves against the negative impact of undisciplined policies in diverging countries. It will also better protect the euro. I hope that the Council will show courage and leadership in this important endeavour. Thank you for your attention.  ']},\n",

       " {'ECB': ['  Staatsschuld und Geldpolitik: Lehren aus der globalen Finanzkrise   Rede von Prof. Dr. Jürgen Stark, Mitglied des Direktoriums der EZB, Münchner Seminare: CES ifo Group Munich & Süddeutsche Zeitung, München, 20. Juni 2011  I. Stabilitätspolitischer Erfolg des Euro  [Folie 2: Euro als Stabilitätsanker für den Euroraum]    Europa steckt aktuell in einer tiefen Krise. Aber: Es ist keine Krise des Euro. Es ist eine Krise der Staatsfinanzen in einigen Ländern der Eurozone. Und: die desolate Lage der Staatsfinanzen in diesen Ländern kommt nicht überraschend. Sie ist das Ergebnis einer jahrelang verfehlten Wirtschafts- und Haushaltspolitik. \\u2028- Stabilitätskriterien wurden sträflich missachtet. \\u2028- Regeln für solide öffentliche Haushalte nicht eingehalten und verwässert. \\u2028- Statistiken geschönt.    Das sind die Ursachen der Schuldenkrise in Europa. Nun gilt es daran anzusetzen, um Europa und die Europäische Integration wieder aufs Gleis zu bringen. Die Frage, die sich also stellt ist: Welche Lehren können wir aus der Krise ziehen?    Lassen Sie mich zunächst auf den stabilitätspolitischen Erfolg des Euro hinweisen. Der Euro hat insbesondere in Deutschland zu einer Periode außerordentlicher Preisstabilität geführt. Seit der Einführung des Euro lag die Teuerungsrate in Deutschland im Schnitt bei 1,5%, im Vergleich zu einer Rate von 2.2% vor Einführung des Euro in den neunziger Jahren. Tatsächlich haben wir im Vergleich zu vergangenen Dekaden die niedrigste durchschnittliche Teuerung seit 1950 in Deutschland erzielt. Dies zeigt, dass der Euro das Versprechen, so stabil und stark wie die D-Mark zu sein, mehr als erfüllt hat. Diese Errungenschaft der europäischen Geldpolitik sollte gerade in Deutschland stärker beachtet werden.   Aber nicht nur in Deutschland hat der Euro für stabile Preise gesorgt. Für den Euroraum als Ganzes lag die durchschnittliche Teuerungsrate bei 2,00% seit Beginn der Währungsunion im Jahre 1999. In den letzten 50 Jahren wurde in keinem der größeren Euroländer ein besseres Ergebnis erzielt. Gleichzeitig ist es uns gelungen, die Inflationserwartungen im Euroraum auf niedrigem Niveau zu verankern – vereinbar mit unserem Ziel, die Inflationsrate unter, aber knapp bei 2% zu halten.   Dies ist zweifelsohne ein großer Erfolg der europäischen Geldpolitik. Er ist umso bemerkenswerter angesichts unzähliger aufwärtsgerichteter Preisschocks, die den Euroraum seit Beginn der Währungsunion getroffen haben. Lassen Sie mich hier nur den kontinuierlichen Anstieg des Ölpreises [von 10 USD per Barrel im Jahre 1998 auf zwischenzeitlich 140 USD Mitte 2008 und heute wieder 120 USD] nennen.    Der stabilitätspolitische Erfolg des Euro ist ebenfalls außerordentlich im Hinblick auf die vielen politischen und finanziellen Verwerfungen, die seit Schaffung der Europäischen Zentralbank aufgetreten sind. Erinnern Sie sich an die Terroranschläge vom 11. September 2001, das Platzen der Internetblase 2000/2001 oder aber die jüngste Krise, der schwersten seit 1929.     [Folie 3: Weitere Vorteile des Euro: Zunehmende Handelsintegration]     Daneben hat gerade Deutschland von der Währungsunion in vielfältiger Weise profitiert. Das wird oftmals vergessen.   So ist der reale Anteil des deutschen Außenhandels innerhalb der Währungsunion stark gestiegen, mehr noch als der interne Handel im Euroraum insgesamt. Gleichzeitig hat Deutschlands Handel mit Ländern außerhalb der Währungsunion kräftig zugenommen, und wiederum mehr als der externe Handels des Euroraums als Ganzes. Natürlich sind diese Entwicklungen nicht alle auf den Euro zurückzuführen. Andere Entwicklungen, wie das starke Wirtschaftswachstum in aufstrebenden Volkswirtschaften wie etwa China oder Indien haben auch maßgeblich zum steigenden Außenhandelsanteil Deutschlands beigetragen.   Die niedrige Inflationsrate in Deutschland hat zusammen mit moderaten Lohnsteigerungen dazu geführt, dass die preisliche Wettbewerbsfähigkeit Deutschlands innerhalb des Euroraums über die letzten 12 Jahre erheblich gestiegen ist. Das gilt auch für den Handel außerhalb des Euroraums, trotz der Aufwertung des Euro. Und schließlich haben die Direktinvestitionen anderer Euroländer in Deutschland deutlich zugenommen.    Hat nun der Euro in der globalen Finanzkrise stabilisierend gewirkt? Fragen wir umgekehrt, wenngleich hypothetisch: Wie würde Europa heute ohne den Euro aussehen? Ohne Zweifel – und davon bin ich überzeugt – würden die Mitgliedsländer sich in einer schlechteren Lage befinden. Sie wären gleichzeitig von vielfältigen Krisen betroffen. Auf nationaler Ebene würden Währungskrisen Hand in Hand mit Wirtschafts-, Banken-, Staatsfinanzkrisen einhergehen. Zudem würde die Gefahr bestehen, dass nationale Währungskrisen auf andere Länder in der Region überspringen, mit der Folge erheblicher politischer Spannungen zwischen den Ländern, wenn etwa eine „Beggar-thy-neighbour“ Politik verfolgt wird.    Der Euro hat nun den „Infektionsherd“ über Wechselkurse beseitigt, die Ansteckungsgefahr der Euroländer untereinander erheblich entschärft und sich in der Krise für alle Länder des Euroraums als Stabilitätsanker und Schutzschild bewährt. Ohne diesen Anker wäre der konjunkturelle Aufschwung, den wir seit dem Frühjahr letzten Jahres im Euroraum, besonders in Deutschland, verzeichnen können, möglicherweise weniger ausgeprägt verlaufen.    Wie bereits erwähnt, erleben wir eine Krise der Staatsfinanzen einzelner Mitgliedsländer der Währungsunion. Drei Länder befinden sich aktuell unter einem EU/IWF-Anpassungsprogramm. Der Beitrag dieser Länder zur Wertschöpfung des Eurogebiets beträgt insgesamt rund 6%.    Die globale Finanzkrise, die im Kern das Produkt aus Markt- und Staatsversagen im aufsichtsrechtlichen Bereich war, und der damit einhergehende starke realwirtschaftliche Abschwung haben die öffentlichen Haushalte massiv belastet – und zwar zusätzlich zu der ohnehin angespannten Finanzlage in vielen Ländern des Euroraums. Aber grundsätzlich haben wir es mit einer hausgemachten Krise zu tun. Jahrelang haben einige Mitgliedsländer eine unvertretbar laxe Haushaltspolitik verfolgt. Zudem haben sich im Euroraum über Jahre hinweg makroökonomische Ungleichgewichte aufgestaut, gegen die die Regierungen nichts unternommen haben. In dieser Hinsicht hätte die Schutzfunktion des Euro möglicherweise „zu gut“ funktioniert. Allerdings: diese Ungleichgewichte, einschließlich der hohen Staatsverschuldung, sind kein spezifisches Problem des Euroraums, sondern globaler Natur. Sie betreffen nahezu alle fortgeschrittenen Volkswirtschaften.    II Institutioneller Rahmen der WWU  [Folie 4: Institutioneller Rahmen der WWU]    Grundsätzlich ist die Europäische Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion auf solidem Fundament gebaut. Allerdings wurde das institutionelle Regelwerk, das für die Wirtschaftsunion aufgestellt wurde, im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr ausgehöhlt. Das Fundament war und ist sehr viel solider was die Währungsunion betrifft. Dieses umfasst eine unabhängige Zentralbank mit eindeutigem Auftrag zur Preisstabilität für den Euroraum als Ganzes. Daneben haben wir – aus guten historischen Gründen – im Vertrag von Maastricht festgelegt, dass es den Zentralbanken des Eurosystems verboten ist, Staatshaushaltsdefizite monetär zu alimentieren. Das sind die Grundpfeiler unserer Geldpolitik. Hinzu kommt die Nicht-Einstandsklausel („no bail-out“ Klausel) die verbietet, dass die EU oder Mitgliedsländer für die Schulden eines anderen Mitgliedslandes einstehen.   Die Prinzipien, die im Rahmen der Wirtschaftsunion gelten, müssen aber erst noch „gelebt“ werden. Hier sind es nun mittlerweile 17 souveräne Staaten, die für ihre jeweiligen nationalen Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitiken verantwortlich sind - und diese untereinander koordinieren müssen. Wie die Krise uns schmerzhaft verdeutlicht, haben weder Koordinierung noch die Einhaltung des gegebenen Regelwerks bisher ausreichend funktioniert. Einige Mitgliedsländer haben den Geist der Wirtschaftsunion bis heute nicht richtig verstanden und nicht gelebt.    a) Geldpolitik  [Folie 5: Geldpolitisches Krisenmanagement: Zinspolitische Maßnahmen]    Die Geldpolitik hat rasch und entschieden auf den mit der Finanzkrise verbundenen abnehmenden Inflationsdruck reagiert. So hat sie den Zins für Hauptrefinanzierungsgeschäfte in nur 7 Monaten um 325 Basispunkte auf 1% gesenkt – und auf diesem sehr niedrigen Niveau für nahezu zwei Jahre belassen. Ein derart niedriges Niveau hatte es seit Jahrzehnten nicht in den Euroländern gegeben.    Dieser ausgesprochen akkommodierende geldpolitische Kurs war zum Höhepunkt der Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise angemessen. Seit einiger Zeit zeigen sich indes Aufwärtsrisiken für die Preisstabilität. Dies hat den EZB-Rat veranlasst, Anfang April die Leitzinsen um 25 Basispunkte anzuheben. Seither hat der Inflationsdruck angehalten. Unser geldpolitischer Kurs ist nach wie vor akkommodierend und wirkt sich unterstützend auf die Konjunktur aus. Auch bestehen weiterhin Aufwärtsrisiken für die Preisstabilität. Deshalb ist große Wachsamkeit geboten. Wir haben klar gemacht, alles zu tun, was geldpolitisch erforderlich ist, um die Inflationserwartungen innerhalb des Eurogebiets fest auf niedrigem Niveau zu verankern.    Dabei beachten wir auch denkbare Gefahren, die eine Geldpolitik in sich birgt, die über einen zu langen Zeitraum die Zinsen auf zu niedrigem Niveau behält. Anhaltend niedrige Zinsen haben das Potential, notwendige Anpassungsmaßnahmen im privaten und öffentlichen Bereich zu verzögern oder zu verhindern. Sie setzen negative Anreizeffekte für Finanzmärkte, Risiken zu unterschätzen. Eine erneute Blasenbildung an den Finanzmärkten könnte die Folge sein. Dass diese Überlegungen nicht nur theoretischer Natur sind, sondern höchst relevant, zeigen die Entwicklungen in den Jahren vor dem Ausbruch der Finanzmarktspannungen im August 2007.    [Folie 6: Geldpolitisches Krisenmanagement: „Unkonventionelle“ Maßnahmen]  In ihrer Reaktion auf die Krise hat die Europäische Zentralbank auch eine Reihe von außerordentlichen geldpolitischen Maßnahmen ergriffen. Diese waren notwendig, um Finanzierungsbedingungen und Kreditströme im Euroraum zu unterstützen, den Transmissionsmechanismus der Geldpolitik aufrechtzuerhalten und eine Ansteckung innerhalb einzelner Finanzmarktsegmente zu verhindern. Als wichtigste Sondermaßnahme haben wir zu einem festen Zinssatz und zu längeren Laufzeiten den Banken im Euroraum unbegrenzt Liquidität zur Verfügung gestellt. Dabei haben wir temporär die Liste der als Sicherheiten zugelassenen Wertpapiere erweitert und Programme für die Wertpapiermärkte eingeführt.   [Folie 7: Finanzkrise: Auswirkungen der geldpolitischen Maßnahmen auf die Bilanz der EZB]    Die Sondermaßnahmen haben zu einer beträchtlichen Bilanzverlängerung beigetragen. Dabei haben wir verstärkt Risiken auf uns genommen. Dies war angesichts der Schwere der Krise durchaus angemessen. Dabei ist im Vergleich zu anderen wichtigen Zentralbanken das Ausmaß der Bilanzverlängerung im Eurosystem relativ begrenzt geblieben. Eine Zentralbank muss in einer solchen Finanzkrise bereit sein, vermehrt Liquidität bereitzustellen und ihre Rolle als Mittler auf dem Geldmarkt stärker wahr zunehmen, um die Risiken für die Volkswirtschaft insgesamt einzudämmen. Eine Ausweitung der Notenbankbilanz und damit einhergehend ein erhöhtes Risiko sind die Folge. Allerdings, die EZB verfolgt ein sehr umfangreiches und konservatives Risikomanagement, das die Risiken überschaubar hält.    Unsere Sondermaßnahmen sind zudem von ihrer Konstruktion her zeitlich begrenzt. In der Tat haben wir bereits Ende 2009 damit begonnen, einige der Maßnahmen allmählich auslaufen zu lassen. Und auch die noch verbliebenen Maßnahmen werden wir rechtzeitig anpassen und keineswegs länger beibehalten als nötig.    Dabei folgt der EZB-Rat keinem vorher festgelegten Ausstiegsplan hinsichtlich der konventionellen und unkonventionellen Maßnahmen. In dieser Hinsicht erlaubt uns unser operationeller Handlungsrahmen größtmögliche Flexibilität. Die Festsetzung der Leitzinsen und die Sondermaßnahmen sind kein Ersatz für einander. Vielmehr ergänzen sie sich gegenseitig. Alle geldpolitischen Entscheidungen der Europäischen Zentralbank werden durch unser Mandat geleitet.   In diesem Sinne wird für die Geldpolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank also auch in Zukunft „business as usual“ gelten. Anders verhält es sich für die Mitgliedsstaaten. Vor allem sind es die Krisenländer, die ihr wirtschafts- und finanzpolitisches Verhalten nachhaltig ändern müssen, wollen sie die Vorteile für Beschäftigung und Wohlstand, die ihnen die Währungsunion bietet, auf Dauer sichern. Welche institutionellen Erneuerungen sind für diesen Prozess notwendig?      b) Wirtschaftpolitik Beginnen wir mit der Wirtschaftspolitik. In vielen Mitgliedsländern ist es hierbei in der Vergangenheit zu erheblichen Versäumnissen gekommen. Notwendige Strukturreformen mit dem Ziel flexiblerer Arbeits- und Produktmärkte blieben aus oder wurden nur sehr zögerlich auf den Weg gebracht. In der Folge haben sich die Wettbewerbsbedingungen gerade in den Krisenländern teilweise erheblich verschlechtert.   [Folie 8: Heterogenität: Lohnstückkostenentwicklung]  Ein wichtiger Indikator für diesen (preislichen) Wettbewerbsverlust ist z.B. die kräftige Zunahme der Lohnstückkosten, die einen Lohnanstieg erkennen lassen, der über das – in vielen Fällen ausgesprochen schwache – Produktivitätswachstum hinaus gehen. So sind die Lohnstückkosten in Ländern wie Griechenland, Portugal oder Irland relativ zu Deutschland im Zeitraum 1999 bis 2007 stark gestiegen.   [Folie 9: Heterogenität: Harmonisierter Verbraucherpreisindex]    Diese Länder sind auch durch überdurchschnittlich hohe Inflationsraten charakterisiert. Und sie verzeichneten neben einer vergleichsweise hohen Zunahme der Lohnstückkosten eine relativ expansive Lohnentwicklung im öffentlichen Sektor.    Ich greife bewusst diese beiden Indikatoren heraus, um den Zusammenhang mit den beiden in der wirtschaftspolitischen Debatte oft parallel diskutierten „Defiziten“ – Leistungsbilanz- und Fiskaldefiziten – plausibel zu machen: so steht zum einen die Lohnstückkostenentwicklung – als Indikator für die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit – in einem Zusammenhang mit zum Teil besorgniserregenden Anstieg der Leistungsbilanzdefizite.     [Folie 10: Heterogenität: Leistungsbilanzunterschiede]    Und die Lohnentwicklung im öffentlichen Sektor steht vielfach in einem Zusammenhang mit dem strukturellen Anstieg bei den Defiziten der öffentlichen Haushalte. In einigen Ländern wurden diese Ungleichgewichte durch exzessive Immobilienpreisentwicklungen sowie die darauf aufbauende, nicht nachhaltige Kreditexpansion verschärft. Der damit verbundene hohe und ebenfalls schuldenfinanzierte private Verbrauch hat zusätzlich zu der Verschlechterung der preislichen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit in einigen Ländern und damit einhergehenden Leistungsbilanzdefiziten beigetragen.   In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich kurz auf die jüngste Diskussion über die Bedeutung von TARGET2-Salden innerhalb des Eurosystems eingehen. Hier liegen Missverständnisse vor. TARGET2-Salden sind das Ergebnis der Verteilung von Zentralbankgeld innerhalb der dezentralen Struktur des Eurosystems. Sie resultieren aus grenzüberschreitenden Zahlungsströmen zwischen Banken im Eurogebiet, die über das europäische Zahlungsverkehrsystem, namentlich TARGET2, abgewickelt werden.     Was ist nun die Ursache für den Anstieg von TARGET2-Salden in jüngster Zeit? Makroökonomische Ungleichgewichte wie Leistungsbilanzdefizite, die wiederum öffentliche und private Spar- und Investitionsentscheidungen widerspiegeln, schlagen sich (saldenmechanisch) in Kapitalströmen nieder. Normalerweise werden die Kapitalströme über die Finanzmärkte abgewickelt. Aber aufgrund der Störungen an den Finanzmärkten und dem Einspringen der EZB als Mittler am Geldmarkt – durch die Sondermaßnahmen wie oben beschrieben – schlägt sich diese Entwicklung nun in den TARGET2-Salden nieder.    Dies führt aber keineswegs dazu, dass es in den Ländern, die TARGET2 Forderungen haben, zu einer Einschränkung der Kreditvergabe zugunsten einer Ausweitung der Kreditvergabe in der Peripherie kommt. Dies wird durch unsere Statistiken bestätigt. Die EZB-Kreditvergabe an Geschäftsbanken in den Ländern, welche TARGET2 Verbindlichkeiten haben, wie Irland, Griechenland und Portugal, wird dazu verwendet, grenzüberschreitende Nettozahlungsabflüsse von Kreditinstituten in diesen Ländern zu Kreditinstituten in anderen Euroländern, wie Deutschland, zu kompensieren. Wegen dieser Zahlungsströme brauchen Banken in Irland, Griechenland und Portugal mehr EZB-Kredit, und Banken in Länder wie Deutschland weniger als früher. Den Banken in Deutschland mangelt es im Allgemeinen nicht an Liquidität, um Kredite vergeben zu können. Im Gegenteil: deutsche Banken nutzen die Einlagenfazilität der EZB. Dies zeigt, dass deutsche Banken tatsächlich Liquiditätsüberschüsse haben.    Heterogenität   Bisweilen wird die Frage aufgeworfen, ob die heterogene wirtschaftliche Entwicklung der einzelnen Mitgliedsstaaten untereinander die einheitliche Geldpolitik überfordert. Zeitweilige Unterschiede beim regionalen Wirtschaftswachstum oder der Inflationsrate sind typisches Merkmal jeder Währungsunion – und damit auch des Euroraums. So sind etwa die Unterschiede in den Lohnstückkosten innerhalb des Euroraums nicht größer als in den Vereinigten Staaten. Solche Unterschiede können darauf zurückzuführen sein, dass sich einige Volkswirtschaften in einem Aufholprozess befinden, oder vorübergehend von asymmetrischen Störungen getroffen werden.    Bedenklich sind jedoch Wachstumsunterschiede über längere Zeit hinweg. Ist zum Beispiel eine dauerhaft hohe Wachstumsrate in einem Land nicht durch nachhaltige angebotsseitige Entwicklungen gerechtfertigt, so schlägt sich die damit verbundene wirtschaftliche Überhitzung in der Regel in starken Lohn- und Preissteigerungen nieder. Diese wiederum führen über die Zeit zu einer zunehmenden Erosion der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit, so wie wir sie in einigen Ländern des Euroraums beobachten konnten.   Derartige Ungleichgewichte müssen korrigiert werden. Dies ist Grundvoraussetzung dafür, dass die Währungsunion reibungslos funktionieren kann. Der Anpassungsbedarf liegt eindeutig bei den so genannten Defizitländern, also solchen Ländern, die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit verloren haben und durch anhaltende Leistungsbilanzdefizite und oft hohe öffentliche und private Verschuldung gekennzeichnet sind. Generell, also auch in Ländern mit Leistungsbilanzüberschüssen wie Deutschland, gilt es, Investitionen in zukunftsweisenden Sektoren voranzutreiben und die Mechanismen struktureller Anpassung weiter zu stärken. Dazu zählt vor allem, die Güter- und Arbeitsmärkte weiter zu flexibilisieren.   Die EZB kann bei diesem notwendigen Abbau bestehender Ungleichgewichte keinen direkten Beitrag leisten. Ihre zentrale Aufgabe besteht darin, die Preisstabilität für den Euroraum zu gewährleisten. Die EZB darf und wird davon nicht abweichen, weil beispielsweise das reale Wachstum oder die Inflationsrate in einigen Mitgliedsländern des Euroraums erheblich niedriger sind als in anderen Mitgliedsstaaten. Aber dies bedeutet nicht, dass der EZB-Rat die Entwicklungen in einem einzelnen Land des Euroraums ignoriert. Spezifische nationale Entwicklungen können eine Rolle für die europäische Geldpolitik spielen, sofern sie für die mittelfristige Entwicklung der Preisstabilität im gesamten Euroraum von Bedeutung sind.   Glaubwürdige Geldpolitik in einer Währungsunion souveräner Mitgliedsstaaten kann und muss den stabilen nominalen Anker liefern, auf den sich alle nationalen und regionalen wirtschaftspolitischen Akteure implizit koordinieren können. Die Mitgliedsländer stehen somit selbst in der Verantwortung die wirtschaftspolitischen Rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen, die dauerhaft die wirtschaftlichen Vorteile des Euro sichern.   Welche wirtschaftspolitischen Optionen haben die Mitgliedsstaaten in der jetzigen Krise, um die Bedingungen für Wachstum und Beschäftigung wiederherzustellen, also wieder wettbewerbsfähig zu werden?   Wettbewerbsfähigkeit kann in einer Währungsunion nur durch anhaltende Phasen der Lohnzurückhaltung – und in manchen Fällen auch tatsächlichen Nominallohnsenkungen – und flexible Lohnstrukturen erreicht werden. Es sollten Maßnahmen ergriffen werden, die darauf zielen, den Lohnfindungsprozess zu dezentralisieren, so dass das Lohnwachstum der Produktivitätsentwicklung auf Firmenebene und auch dem regionalen Niveau der Arbeitslosigkeit Rechnung trägt. In einigen Ländern gilt es, bestehende Lohnindexierungssysteme abzubauen. Auch Reformen mit dem Ziel, die Arbeitsmärkte zu flexibilisieren, sind absolut erforderlich. Insbesondere diskriminieren bestehende Mindestlohnregelungen als auch übermäßige Kündigungsschutzregelungen häufig vor allem bestimmte Gruppen – junge, gering ausgebildete, aber auch Langzeitarbeitslose –und müssen daher dringend reformiert werden.   Maßnahmen, die den Wettbewerb auf den Gütermärkten intensivieren tragen dazu bei, dass notwendige Strukturveränderungen in den Volkswirtschaften in Europa rasch voranschreiten können. Strukturelle Veränderungen sind vor allem wichtig in Ländern, deren Wachstum sich vor der Krise auf nicht-handelbaren Sektoren, insbesondere den Bau- und Immobiliensektor, stützte und nicht nachhaltig war. Verkrustungen, die Ressourcen erneut hin zu export-orientierten Sektoren lenken und Innovationen behindern, müssen dringend abgebaut werden.    Reformen, die den Wettbewerb in den Netzwerkindustrien und im Bereich der Dienstleistungen vorantreiben, tragen entscheidend zu einer Verbesserung der Wachstums- und Beschäftigungsaussichten bei und müssen fortgeführt werden. Insbesondere müssen die Mitgliedsländer die Europäische Dienstleistungsrichtlinie zügig umsetzen.    Darüber hinaus können Strukturreformen, die zu einer Stärkung des Potentialwachstums beitragen, eine Rückführung überhöhter Schuldenstände vereinfachen. Das betrifft insbesondere Mitgliedsstaaten, in denen vor der Krise Vermögenspreise – insbesondere Immobilienpreise – übermäßig gewachsen sind.    Es reicht aber nicht aus, bestehende Ungleichgewichte abzubauen. Auch müssen die Voraussetzungen dafür geschaffen werden, dass keine neuen Ungleichgewichte entstehen. Diese Herausforderung lässt sich nicht ohne institutionelle Reformen auf europäischer Ebene bewältigen. Im Kern geht es darum, den Rahmen zur Koordinierung längst überfälliger Strukturreformen grundlegend zu überarbeiten und zu stärken.   Auf europäischer Ebene werden solche Maßnahmen im Rahmen der Europa 2020 Strategie koordiniert und überwacht. Europa 2020 hat die frühere Lissabonstrategie abgelöst. Die Lissabonstrategie hat vor allem mit Blick darauf, Wachstum und Beschäftigung in Europa zu stärken, im Wesentlichen enttäuscht.    Die Gründe für die enttäuschende Lissabon-Bilanz sind vielfältig. Es fehlte vor allem an Überwachungsinstrumenten. So konnte nur mangelhaft überprüft werden ob und inwieweit, wirtschaftspolitische Empfehlungen auch umgesetzt wurden. Die nationalen politischen Entscheidungsträger haben dann auch die an sie gerichteten Empfehlungen zu wirtschafts-, struktur- und arbeitsmarktpolitischen Maßnahmen häufig praktisch ignoriert.    Die reformierten Rahmenbedingungen unter Europa 2020 stärken die Rolle des Europäischen Rats in der Umsetzung der Reform-Agenda, und sie haben auch zum Ziel, die Mitgliedstaaten selbst in der Festlegung ihrer nationalen Reformziele stärker einzubinden. Darüber hinaus wird gegenwärtig über ein integriertes Regelwerk zur engeren wirtschaftlichen Überwachung der Mitgliedsländer verhandelt. Damit sollen übermäßigen wirtschaftlichen Ungleichgewichte in Zukunft verhindert werden.    Es hat sich gezeigt, dass solche Krisen auch erhebliche Risiken für die Währungsunion insgesamt bergen können. Es ist daher wichtig, dass alle Beteiligten den Ernst und die Dringlichkeit der aktuellen Lage verstehen: Die neuen Regelungen müssen klar sein. Sie müssen darauf zugeschnitten sein, Bedingungen zu schaffen, die wirtschaftliche Ungleichgewichte in einer Währungsunion verhindern.    Die gegenwärtigen Vorschläge sehen vor, dass ausgehend von einer überschaubaren, klar definierten Anzahl an makroökonomischen Indikatoren die wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungen der einzelnen Mitgliedsländer genauer kontrolliert werden und so frühzeitig auf Fehlentwicklungen reagiert werden kann.     [Folie 11: Wirtschaftspolitische Überwachung]    Die Leistungsbilanz, die Lohnstückkosten, der Verschuldungsgrad privater Haushalte oder nationale Vermögenspreisentwicklungen sind solche Kennzahlen, die in die Bewertung eines Landes einfließen sollten. Bei Fehlentwicklungen werden hier rechtzeitig Empfehlungen ausgesprochen werden. Bei Missachtung können Sanktionen verhängt werden. Allerdings wäre es aus unserer Sicht erforderlich, die vorgesehenen Automatismen zu verstärken und Sanktionen frühzeitig und schrittweise greifen zu lassen.   Zurzeit wird darüber verhandelt, wie man außergewöhnliche Veränderungen in der Wettbewerbsposition eines Landes erkennt, verhindert oder korrigiert. Das gilt sowohl für außergewöhnliche Verschlechterungen, also auch für außergewöhnliche Verbesserungen der Wettbewerbsposition. Wir haben unseren Standpunkt hierzu wiederholt deutlich gemacht: Es ist wesentlich, dass der Überwachungsrahmen vor allem auf solche gesamtwirtschaftlichen Ungleichgewichte ausgerichtet ist, die das reibungslose Funktionieren der Währungsunion gefährden. Dies sind beträchtliche Wettbewerbsverluste, anhaltende Leistungsbilanzdefizite, untragbare Anstiege der Vermögenspreise, sowie eine hohe Verschuldung. Eine symmetrische Ausgestaltung der Überwachung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit birgt die Gefahr, dass sich die Bemühungen nicht auf die größten Herausforderungen für die Währungsunion konzentrieren.    Hohe Leistungsbilanzüberschüsse und außergewöhnliche Zunahmen der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit eines Landes können im Einzelfall durchaus ein Symptom binnenwirtschaftlicher Probleme sein. Sie können beispielsweise auf eine schwache inländische Nachfrage hindeuten oder auch auf Fehlanreize im inländischen Arbeitsmarkt, die eine übermäßige Orientierung der Wirtschaft auf profitable Exportsektoren bewirken können.    Allerdings sollten solche Probleme im Rahmen der Strategie Europa 2020 betrachtet werden. Das gilt ebenso für weitere wirtschaftspolitische Ziele, wie beispielsweise eine höhere Energieeffizienz, die Verbesserung der Beschäftigungschancen und die Verhinderung von Armut in Europa: Diese können besser im Rahmen von Europa 2020 verfolgt werden.    Das neue Verfahren zur Vermeidung und Korrektur makroökonomischer Ungleichgewichte muss hingegen möglichst effektiv and klar auf dieses Ziel ausgerichtet werden. Diese Überwachungsprozesse darf nicht zu einer wirtschaftspolitischen Feinsteuerung in Form kurzfristiger Nachfragesteuerung führen. Wenn wir hier die Ziele und die Überwachungsprozesse vermischen, werden wir in Zukunft kaum in der Lage sein, wirtschaftliche Ungleichgewichte in Europa erfolgreich zu korrigieren und zu verhindern.    c) Fiskalpolitik Lassen Sie mich nun zur Fiskalpolitik kommen. Wie bereits gesagt: Wir sehen uns im Moment einer Krise der Staatsfinanzen in einigen Ländern der Eurozone gegenüber. Wie Sie wissen, mussten Griechenland, Irland und zuletzt auch Portugal finanzielle Unterstützung von der EU sowie des Internationalen Währungsfonds in Anspruch nehmen. Diese finanzielle Unterstützung ist an strikte Bedingungen geknüpft: für alle drei Länder bedeutet dies eine wirtschaftspolitische Kehrtwende mit striktem Konsolidierungskurs und umfassenden Strukturreformen, um wieder wettbewerbsfähig zu werden. Die konsequente Umsetzung dieser Programme ist von entscheidender Bedeutung, um die makroökonomische Entwicklung in diesen Ländern zu stabilisieren und die Kapitalmärkte von der Nachhaltigkeit der öffentlichen Finanzen zu überzeugen.  [Folie 12: Entwicklung der Staatsverschuldung: Euroländer]  Die finanzpolitische Situation ist nach der Krise aber auch in anderen Euroländern besorgniserregend. Seit 2007 ist die Staatsverschuldung bezogen auf das Bruttoinlandprodukt in der Eurozone um fast 20 Prozentpunkte angestiegen. Zuletzt lag die Schuldenquote bei rund 85% und damit deutlich über dem 60% Referenzwert des Maastrichtvertrags. Dazu haben nicht zuletzt starke Anstiege in der Verschuldung in Deutschland, Frankreich, Italien und Spanien beigetragen. Laut der Frühjahrsprognose der Europäischen Kommission wird die Schuldendynamik über den Prognosezeitraum bis 2012 zwar nachlassen, der Aufwärtstrend bleibt jedoch intakt.   [Folie 13: Entwicklung der Staatsverschuldung: Internationaler Vergleich]    Der internationale Vergleich zeigt, dass sich die Verschuldungssituation sowie die mittelfristige Entwicklung in den USA und insbesondere in Japan noch deutlich bedrohlicher darstellen als in der Eurozone.    Die Gründe für die starke Zunahme der Verschuldung im Zuge der globalen Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise sind zahlreich. So sind die öffentlichen Defizite aufgrund von finanzpolitischen Stabilisierungsmaßnahmen sowie der konjunkturell bedingten Verschlechterung der Haushalte in vielen Ländern stark angestiegen. Hinzu kamen Maßnahmen zur Stützung des Finanzsektors.    Simulationsrechnungen verdeutlichen, dass die gegenwärtige Ausrichtung der Finanzpolitik in allen genannten Wirtschaftsregionen nicht tragfähig ist und langfristig eine Explosion der Staatsverschuldung impliziert. Wir haben es derzeit mit der höchsten staatlichen Verschuldung in Friedenszeiten zu tun.    [Folie 14: Schuldensimulationen: Eurozone]  Die jährlichen Konsolidierungsanstrengungen, die notwendig sind um lediglich eine Stabilisierung der Verschuldung zu erreichen, sind bereits beträchtlich. In der Eurozone würde eine jährliche Anpassung um 0.5 Prozent der Wirtschaftskraft erst in etwa 7 Jahren zu einer Trendumkehr bei der Verschuldung führen. Sogar bei einer jährlichen Anstrengung von 1 Prozent des BIP würde der Schuldenstand im Euroaggregat erst wieder etwa im Jahr 2030 unter die 60 Prozentmarke des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts fallen.   [Folie 15: Schuldensimulationen: Internationaler Vergleich]    Aufgrund der schlechteren fiskalischen Ausgangssituation zeichnen die Simulationsrechnungen für die USA, das Vereinigte Königreich und Japan ein noch bedrohlicheres Bild.    Im Anbetracht des außerordentlich starken Konjunktureinbruchs waren die finanzpolitischen Maßnahmen, die zur Abfederung der Rezession beschlossen wurden, sicherlich gerechtfertig. Gleichzeitig bin ich jedoch der Meinung, dass die krisenhafte Zuspitzung der budgetären Situation in einigen Euroländern nicht ausschließlich der Krise zuzuschreiben ist, sondern eine Entwicklung mit Ansage war.     [Folie 16: Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts: Die Bilanz]    Viele Regierungen haben trotz des günstigen konjunkturellen Umfelds bis 2007 ihre finanzpolitischen Hausaufgaben nicht gemacht. Sie haben die mittelfristigen Haushaltsziele, die der präventive Arm des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts vorgibt, verfehlt. Als Resultat war der finanzpolitische Spielraum bereits zu Beginn der Krise oftmals begrenzt oder nicht vorhanden. Die Folge war, dass die Mehrzahl der Mitgliedsstaaten die 3% Defizitgrenze - zum Teil deutlich - überschritten hat, sodass Verfahren aufgrund übermäßiger Defizite eingeleitet werden mussten.    Rückblickend muss daher festgestellt werden, dass der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt nicht konsequent genug umgesetzt wurde. Fristen für die Erreichung von Konsolidierungszielen wurden immer wieder verlängert, Verfahren bei übermäßigem Defizit vorzeitig ausgesetzt, Sanktionen nie verhängt. Konsolidierungsprogramme beruhten oft auf zu optimistischen Wachstumsannahmen.   Aus meiner Sicht hat die Reform des Stabilitätspaktes im Jahr 2005 dazu maßgeblich beigetragen, da sie zu einer stärkeren Politisierung der Entscheidungen führte. Diese Aufweichung des finanzpolitischen Regelwerks hat dessen Bindungswirkung maßgeblich unterminiert.     [Folie 17: Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts: Reformvorschläge]    Es ist daher zu begrüßen, dass ein breit angelegter Reformprozess zur Stärkung des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts initiiert wurde. Eckpfeiler der angestrebten Reform sind einen stärkerer Fokus auf Verschuldungsentwicklungen, einen effektiverer Sanktionsmechanismus sowie eine umfassendere nationale Umsetzung des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts.    Die Europäische Zentralbank hat zu diesen Vorschlägen bereits Stellung genommen und wir sehen das Reformpaket als einen Schritt in die richtige Richtung an. Allerdings bleibt es hinter dem zurück was notwendig gewesen wäre, um eine effektive Koordinierung der Fiskalpolitik, insbesondere im Euroraum sicherzustellen.   Vor allem ist bedauerlich, dass bisher die Gelegenheit verpasst wurde, einen stärkeren Automatismus einzuführen. Denn nach wie vor hätten die Europäische Kommission sowie der Europäische Rat maßgeblichen Einfluss auf wichtige Entscheidungen etwa bzgl. der Erteilung von Empfehlungen sowie der Bestimmung der Höhe von Sanktionen. Ein entscheidender Schwachpunkt des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts wird bei der angestrebten Reform also nicht in überzeugender Weise behoben.   Dies ist umso bedauerlicher im Hinblick auf die beträchtlichen finanzpolitischen Herausforderungen, denen sich viele Länder der Eurozone gegenübersehen. Der Konsolidierungsprozess nach der Krise hat nun auf breiter Front begonnen. Im Rahmen der aktualisierten Stabilitätsprogramme haben die Mitgliedsländer Strategien zur Korrektur der übermäßigen Defizite vorgelegt. Diese gilt es nun Punkt für Punkt und in voller Übereinstimmung mit den Vorgaben des Europäischen Rates umzusetzen.   Darüber hinaus wird es in vielen Mitgliedsländern notwendig sein, die Sparanstrengungen auch längerfristig aufrechtzuerhalten, um die Verschuldung auf ein nachhaltiges Niveau im Einklang mit den Vorgaben des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts zurückzuführen. Dies ist unerlässlich, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die erheblichen finanzpolitischen Risiken aufgrund des demographischen Wandels.    Der notwendige Konsolidierungsprozess sollte durch eine Stärkung nationaler Budgetinstitutionen im Einklang mit der vorgesehenen Ratsdirektive flankiert werden, um so die Glaubwürdigkeit der Konsolidierungsstrategien zu untermauern.     Gibt es eine Alternative zu diesem notwendigen Konsolidierungsprozess? Im Falle von Griechenland wird derzeit in vielen Diskussionen eine Umschuldung als einziger Ausweg, als schnelle und einfache Lösung erachtet. Dies ist aber eine Illusion. Eine Schuldenreduzierung kann nicht die wirtschaftlichen und strukturellen Probleme, die für die Krise verantwortlich sind, beheben. Tatsächlich könnte sich die Lage durch eine solche Maßnahme sogar verschlimmern, da eine Umschuldung die Anreize für die betroffenen Regierungen schwächt, notwendige Reformen umzusetzen. Ein solcher Vorschlag verkennt zudem die massiven negativen Folgen für das betroffene Land. Der Zugang zu internationalen Finanzmärkten könnte für einen langen Zeitraum behindert sein, was die weitere wirtschaftliche Entwicklung dämpfen dürfte. Zudem kann eine Umstrukturierung der Staatsschulden in einem Land das dortige Bankensystem erschüttern. Nicht zuletzt kann eine Umschuldung eines Eurolandes erhebliche Nachteile für das gesamte Währungsgebiet mit sich bringen, da es zu neuen Verwerfungen an den Finanzmärkten kommen kann. Es gibt folglich keine Alternative zur Konsolidierung des Staatshaushaltes und strukturelle Reformen.     d) Ein europäischer Mechanismus zur Krisenbewältigung  [Folie 18: Mechanismen zur Krisenbewältigung]    Der europäische Mechanismus zur Krisenbewältigung, auf den ich jetzt näher eingehen möchte, ist ebenso wenig ein Ersatz für die notwendigen umfassenden Anpassungen. Als im Mai 2010 die europäische Schuldenkrise in Griechenland ihren ersten Höhepunkt erreichte, war schnelles Handeln gefragt, um ein übergreifen der Krise auf den Euroraum als Ganzes zu verhindern. Wie Sie wissen, haben die EU-Staaten dazu zunächst - zusammen mit dem IWF - Gelder für Griechenland bereitgestellt. Gleichzeitig wurden die Europäische Finanzstabilitätsfazilität (EFSF) und der Finanzstabilitäts-Mechanismus (EFSM) gegründet.   Zudem wurde die Schaffung eines permanenten Mechanismus zur Bewältigung von Finanzkrisen zur Sicherstellung der Finanzstabilität im Euroraum als Ganzes beschlossen. Der Europäische Stabilitäts-Mechanismus (ESM) wird die bestehenden, kurzfristig eingerichteten und zeitlich begrenzten Mechanismen im Juli 2013 ablösen.     [Folie 19: Europäischer Stabilitäts-Mechanismus]    Über einige Details des ESM Vertrages wird noch verhandelt. Erlauben Sie mir aber im Folgenden die Eckpfeiler des ESM kurz zu umreißen, wie sie vom Europäischen Rat in März verabschiedet wurden: \\u2028- er ist eine internationale Organisation, basierend auf einem Vertrag zwischen den Mitgliedsstaaten der Eurozone, geführt von den Finanzministern des Euroraums. Wichtige Entscheidungen – über die Gewährung von finanzieller Hilfe, über die Höhe der Kreditfähigkeit des Mechanismus und über das Instrumentarium – werden im Einverständnis getroffen. \\u2028- Finanzielle Mittel aus dem ESM werden nur auf Antrag gewährt, unterliegen strengen Auflagen zur Umsetzung von fiskal- und strukturpolitischen Korrekturen, werden primär in Form von Krediten mit Zinsen über dem Marktniveau und sehen von Fall zu Fall eine Beteiligung privater Gläubiger vor. Insgesamt erhält der ESM auch eine solide Kapitalstruktur.    Wie ist die Schaffung des Europäischen Stabilisierungsmechanismus zu beurteilen? In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich auf zwei Sachverhalte nachdrücklich hinweisen.   Erstens, der ESM ist so konstruiert, dass Fehlanreize für die Haushaltspolitik der Mitgliedstaaten des Euroraums minimiert werden. Moralisches Risiko lässt sich bei einem Versicherungsmechanismus, wie es der ESM ist, nicht vollkommen ausschließen. Nicht umsonst lehnt sich der ESM jedoch in seiner institutionellen Ausgestaltung und seinen Instrumenten sehr eng an den IWF an und bezieht ihn darüber hinaus in seine Aktivitäten mit ein. Insbesondere werden finanzielle Hilfen ausschließlich nach einer Tragfähigkeitsprüfung des öffentlichen Haushalts des betroffenen Mitgliedsstaates und unter dem Vorbehalt der Umsetzung eines strikten Anpassungsprogramms gewährt.    Zweitens ist der ESM keineswegs der Einstieg in eine Transferunion. Er ist vielmehr als Komplement zu einer reformierten europäischen wirtschaftspolitischen Koordinierung – also des verschärften Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspaktes und des neu eingerichteten makroökonomischen Überwachungsmechanismus – gedacht. Insbesondere sollen diese Reformen die europäische Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion auf eine solide institutionelle Basis stellen, Ungleichgewichte und Überschuldung von vorneherein vermeiden und so das Risiko einer erneuten Finanzkrise im Euroraum minimieren. Sie sollen also den ESM praktisch redundant werden lassen.   Aber eine Haushaltskrise kann nie völlig ausgeschlossen werden. Es entspricht dem Prinzip angemessener Sorgfalt, in Zukunft besser vorbereitet zu sein und ein letztinstanzliches Instrument vorzuhalten, um im Zweifelsfall einer Bedrohung für die gesamtwirtschaftliche Stabilität des Euroraums effektiv entgegentreten zu können.     e) Gesamtbeurteilung der Reformvorhaben   [Folie 20: Gesamtbeurteilung]    Kommen wir zu einer Gesamtbeurteilung der eingeleiteten institutionellen Reformen. Diese sind notwendig, da das „Mikro-Management“ von Fiskal- und Wirtschaftpolitik auf nationaler Ebene häufig versagt hat. Viele Mitgliedsländer haben sich unzureichend an die Bedingungen der Währungsunion angepasst. Sie haben von dem einheitlichen Wirtschafts- und Währungsraum profitiert, aber gleichzeitig ungleichgewichtiges und nicht nachhaltiges Wirtschaftswachstum gefördert und über ihre Verhältnisse gelebt. Sie haben sich schlicht nicht damit abgefunden, dass die Mitgliedschaft in einer Währungsunion neben der Aufgabe einer nationalen Geldpolitik auch staatliche Souveränitäts-Einschränkungen im wirtschafts- und finanzpolitischen Bereich mit sich bringt.    Der institutionelle Rahmen der Wirtschaft- und Währungsunion wurde im Laufe der Zeit unterhöhlt. Auch bei der Auslegung der Qualifikationskriterien für die Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion war man zu lax. Ausschlaggebend waren immer wieder politische Erwägungen. Die aktuelle Finanz- und Fiskalkrise hat diesen Rahmen weiter verändert, in dem drei Mitgliedsstatten umfangreiche finanzielle Unterstützung gewährt wurde. Das Regelwerk für den Wirtschaftsteil der WWU wurde mit den Beschlüssen des Europäischen Rates vom März 2011 umgestaltet.     Wird diese Reform die Krise im Eurogebiet lösen und ähnliche Krisen in Zukunft vermeiden? Nun, die Reformen sind ein wichtiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung. Aber sie entsprechen keinesfalls dem Quantensprung, den wir erforderlich halten, um Stabilität und ein reibungsloses Funktionieren der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion zu gewährleisten. Das neue Regelwerk bietet weiterhin zu viel Raum für Diskretion, ist kein klarer Schritt in die zumindest stückweise Abgabe nationaler Souveränität, birgt die Gefahr einer Detailsteuerung und schließt „moral hazard“ nicht vollständig aus.   Zur Lösung der Krise gilt es, das neue Regelwerk zügig und konsequent umzusetzen. Alle Mitgliedsstaaten müssen nun ihre Haushalts- und Wirtschaftspolitik auf einen nachhaltigen Kurs bringen. Kommt jeder Mitgliedsstaat seiner Verantwortung innerhalb der Währungsunion nach, wird der Einsatz des ESM redundant. Zukünftige Krisen bleiben aber nicht ausgeschlossen. Hier sind die Regierungen des Euroraums gefragt, entschieden zum Erfolg der Europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion beizutragen.    Ich komme zum Schluss auf meine Eingangsfrage zurück: Welche Lehren können wir aus der aktuellen Krise ziehen? Eines ist klar: Wir benötigen eine stärkere Entpolitisierung von Entscheidungsprozessen. Gleichzeitig sind stärkere Regelbindungen und institutionelle Reformen notwendig, um die richtigen Anreize zu setzen. Insbesondere benötigen wir Mitgliedsstaaten, die verstehen, dass sie ihre nationale wirtschafts- wie fiskalpolitische Autonomie in ihrem eigenen Interesse teilweise zum Wohle der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion aufgeben müssen.    Die geldpolitische Strategie und der operationelle Handlungsrahmen der EZB haben sich bewährt. Die EZB hat ein klares Mandat. Das haben wir erfüllt. Wir werden auch weiterhin diesem Mandat folgen und bei Risiken für die Preisstabilität rasch, entschieden und in voller Unabhängigkeit handeln und weiterhin den Prinzipien einer soliden Geldpolitik und unseren Regeln folgen. In diesem Sinne bleiben wir Stabilitäts- und Vertrauensanker für den Euroraum.     '],\n",

Sra. Rectora de la Universidad de Málaga, Excmo. Sr. Alcalde de Málaga, Autoridades, Excmos. e Ilmos. Miembros del Claustro, Sras y Sres.  Agradecimientos Permítanme comenzar mis palabras con una expresión de agradecimiento. Es un inmenso honor estar hoy en Málaga, rodeado de familiares, colegas, amigos, autoridades y todos Vds., con ocasión de este solemne acto de investidura como Doctor Honoris Causa. Doblemente honrado me siento por el origen de la propuesta. Málaga, su Universidad y su Facultad de Ciencias Económicas están ligados a mis primeros pasos como investigador. Aquí presenté mi primer paper científico, con ocasión de un congreso internacional de economía matemática y econometría en 1982. Y desde entonces mi vida profesional se ha cruzado en innumerables ocasiones con la estela de esta universidad. El Prof. Sánchez Maldonado ha glosado esta relación de manera incompleta. No ha dicho, porque a mí me corresponde, que algunos de los mejores alumnos a los que he tenido el privilegio de enseñar en el Centro de Estudios Monetarios y Financieros –uno de los mejores postgrados en economía de Europa- salieron de las aulas de esta Facultad. Y tampoco se ha referido, porque a él no le toca, al enorme respeto con que el Prof. Fuentes Quintana hablaba en público y en privado de la “Escuela de Málaga”, referencia de buen hacer en nuestra disciplina desde los años 80. Que el cabeza visible de esa escuela, el colega y sin embargo amigo Sánchez Maldonado, haya sido el encargado de hacer la Laudatio me llena de alegría y de profunda satisfacción.  Mi circunstancia Satisfacción, sí, pero llena de perplejidad. ¿O acaso no se sentirían Vds. desconcertados si les dijesen que comparten honores con Mario Vargas Llosa o Antonio Banderas? Si no es un error, ello sólo puede querer decir que esta Universidad practica la discriminación positiva con personas como yo. Y con esta afirmación no quiero poner en cuestión las buenas intenciones que han animado la propuesta, sin duda debatida y madurada en los órganos correspondientes. Pero al mismo tiempo les digo –sin atisbo de falsa modestia, pecado mortal de los vanidosos- que soy plenamente consciente de que este reconocimiento lo es, en gran parte, a las afortunadas circunstancias que han jalonado mi trayectoria. Y la fortuna puede guiarse hasta cierto punto, mediante la voluntad y los principios morales, pero azar es al fin y al cabo. Por eso decía Albert Camus que el éxito y el reconocimiento son fáciles de obtener, y lo difícil merecerlos. Es fortuna haber crecido en un entorno intelectualmente estimulante. A mi memoria viene la figura de mi padre, su rica biblioteca y el presupuesto para libros que siempre tuve a mi disposición. También lo es haber encontrado guía y consejo en personas de la talla de Don Enrique Fuentes Quintana, santo y seña de nuestra profesión desde los años 70, quien me dio uno de mis primeros trabajos, y Emilio Albi, a quien debo mi primer puesto docente y el estímulo para ampliar estudios en EE.UU. Allí, en el imaginario de Paul Auster hecho realidad, mi alma mater, la Universidad de Columbia, me enseñó a investigar, de la mano de Premios Nobel como Edmund Phelps, William Vickrey o Robert Mundell, entre otros excelentes maestros. A otro Premio Nobel de Columbia, Joseph Stiglitz, bien entendido que en su encarnación previa a su paso por el Banco Mundial, debo mi fascinación por la economía pública moderna. Una disciplina que pude ejercer con la plenitud que supuso –de nuevo la fortuna- poder suceder a Fuentes Quintana antes de los treinta y jugar en el dream team de la economía pública en España, mi querido Departamento de Hacienda Pública de la Complutense. En un día como hoy, con el altavoz que la generosidad de este claustro me concede, y antes de entrar en materias de más actualidad, no puedo dejar pasar la ocasión de manifestar en voz alta tres convicciones que creo de alguna trascendencia fuera de las paredes universitarias en las que hoy nos encontramos. Primera, nuestras sociedades no pueden ser plenamente libres ni responsables sin un salto cualitativo en lo que podríamos llamar “alfabetización financiera”. Ante las loas desmedidas a la teoría de la relatividad, Einstein no tuvo empacho en reconocer que el interés compuesto es la fuerza más poderosa de la galaxia. Y todas las encuestas disponibles, incluso en los países más avanzados, coinciden en señalar una conclusión preocupante: junto a un sentimiento mayoritario de complacencia en este terreno, la inmensa mayoría de la gente no entiende el interés compuesto, ni la inflación, ni las consecuencias de endeudarse demasiado, ni la necesidad de diversificar las colocaciones financieras, o de planificar el ahorro para la jubilación o para imprevistos. Si los gobiernos fueran conscientes de cuánta pobreza y sufrimiento material podríamos ahorrarnos, no repararían en medios para mejorar la formación en economía y finanzas desde la escuela. Segunda, los economistas como profesión tenemos una función social, y esto alcanza a los docentes y los investigadores en primer lugar. O la teoría y la investigación están orientados a la acción, o no son nada. Pura gratificación estéril. Los economistas debemos rechazar ser parte de esa masa peligrosa de individuos a la que se refería Pau Casals. Peligrosa no por lo que hace sino por todo lo contrario: por sentarse a ver lo que pasa. Estamos obligados a contribuir a mejorar la toma de decisiones que tienen impacto en el bienestar de la sociedad. De nuevo debo recurrir a Einstein, esa fuente inagotable de sabiduría y compromiso social: “Si los hechos no encajan en la teoría, cambie los hechos”. Participe, responsabilícese, discuta, proponga, no se siente a ver lo que pasa. He tratado de cumplir con este compromiso desde mi retorno de los EE.UU., al cabo del cuál José Borrell, siendo entonces Secretario de Estado de Hacienda, me ofreció desarrollar investigaciones para mejorar el sistema tributario y la financiación autonómica. Estas tareas de investigación orientadas a la acción las he podido realizar –de nuevo la fortuna- sin limitación de medios en FUNCAS, en el Banco Mundial y en muchas otras instituciones cuya relación les ahorraré, pues ya han sido mencionadas por mi glosador, con una excepción: el Centro de Estudios de Economía Pública de la Fundación BBVA, dirigida por José Ángel Sánchez Asiaín. Nadie como este gigante de nuestra profesión, catedrático de Hacienda Pública, secretario general técnico del Ministerio de Industria, creador del Servicio de Estudios del Banco de Bilbao, catalizador de la reordenación del sector bancario en los 80 desde la presidencia del BBV, y hoy presidente de la Fundación COTEC para la Tecnología, presidente de la Fundación de Ayuda Contra la Drogadicción, y Académico de Morales y de la Historia. Nadie como él puede representar el ideal del economista comprometido. Él me permitió aprender a su lado y, al mismo tiempo, ejercer de empresario de investigadores, poniendo fondos a disposición de aquellos mejor preparados para arrojar luz sobre cuestiones de la máxima relevancia social, desde las pensiones a financiación de las competencias autonómicas. La tercera convicción que quería traerles aquí parece más abstracta, aunque no puede ser más concreta hoy, cuando nuestros socios del área euro nos piden que reformemos nuestra economía para volver a crecer y a crear empleo: es tanto lo que debemos a Europa que ningún esfuerzo en contribuir a su construcción será baldío. Europa fue la gran catalizadora del desmantelamiento de las instituciones del antiguo régimen, y a ella le debemos el impulso para modernizar nuestra economía y las favorables condiciones que trajo consigo la creación del euro. En lugar de especular, parafraseando a John F. Kennedy, sobre qué más puede hacer Europa por nosotros, deberíamos preguntarnos cómo podemos mejor ayudar a su fortalecimiento. En mi opinión, la mejor contribución española a Europa es hacer lo posible para disciplinar nuestras finanzas públicas, hacer lo imposible para dotar a nuestro mercado de trabajo de flexibilidad y seguridad e integrar a esos jóvenes que hoy expresan en plazas y barrios su indignación, y hacer lo necesario para impedir que la falta de competencia, las ineficiencias del sistema educativo y la inflación erosionen año tras año nuestra competitividad. Quizás no tenga mérito que diga estas cosas alguien como yo, que nací en el año de la entrada en vigor del Tratado de Roma, que crecí idealizando a los vecinos de continente, que me doctoré cuando España finalmente se integraba en la Comunidad Europea, que fui nombrado miembro del Consejo de Gobierno del Banco de España cuando éste adquiría independencia en virtud del Tratado de Maastricht, que accedí a su Comité Ejecutivo cuando nacía el euro y que posteriormente, en 2004, fui elegido por jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de la Unión Europea para integrarme en los Consejos Ejecutivo y de Gobierno del Banco Central Europeo (BCE). La fortuna se me aparece de nuevo en estos años, asociada a seis hombres insignes que confiaron en mí, con los que he trabajado codo con codo y de los que no he hecho sino aprender: Jean-Claude Trichet, Luis Ángel Rojo, que nos ha dejado recientemente, Jaime Caruana, Rodrigo Rato, Joaquín Almunia y mi predecesor en Frankfurt, Eugenio Domingo.  Desde la experiencia de siete largos años en esta atalaya podría decir muchísimas cosas. A la crisis dedicaré algunas reflexiones en unos momentos pero antes les transmitiré dos impresiones. Primera, pese a las apariencias, nada hay más natural que un hacendista con responsabilidades en política monetaria. Los hacendistas nos ocupamos de los impuestos, y pocas cosas pueden ser más gratificantes que trabajar en reducir al mínimo el impuesto más injusto, más distorsionante y menos democrático que existe, que es la inflación. Segunda, las tareas de asegurar la estabilidad de precios y contribuir a la estabilidad financiera son complejas, tienen una fuerte base técnica y requieren de un sentido práctico. Ambos los he podido cultivar y desarrollar, gracias al espíritu de equipo que reina entre los miembros del Comité Ejecutivo del BCE, y al privilegio -¿de nuevo la fortuna?- de estar al frente de las responsabilidades del servicio de estudios y de las operaciones de mercado, que hemos tenido que utilizar con tanta creatividad durante estos años extraordinarios. Permítanme, ahora sí, algunas reflexiones sobre este exigente periodo.  Como diría el bueno de Paco Umbral en aquella inolvidable entrevista con Mercedes Milá, hoy he venido a hablar de mi libro. No de uno de los que he escrito para reflexionar en voz alta, o para comunicar a la comunidad científica los resultados de mi investigación, o para ayudarme y quizás apoyar a otros en la gratificante docencia de Economía y Hacienda Pública. Debo hablarles de algunos de los capítulos de ese libro inconcluso que llevo al menos cuatro años escribiendo en coautoría. Una coautoría múltiple que incluye a mis colegas del Comité Ejecutivo y del Consejo de Gobierno del BCE, a mi familia –que pese a mis ausencias físicas y mentales creo que todavía me soporta y hoy me acompaña en una pequeña representación- y mis amigos y colegas, que tengo más abandonados de lo que mi residencia en Alemania justificaría. Es el libro de la gestión -en primera línea- de la presente crisis, un concepto difícil de explicar y que hace cambiar de color la cara de mi hija pequeña cada vez que escucha el término. ¿Qué enemigo es ese sin rostro ni forma, inmaterial pero devastador? ¿Le estamos venciendo? ¿Cómo serán las cosas cuando haya desaparecido? Se trata de una agenda demasiado ambiciosa para cubrirla en este acto solemne, pero permítanme unos breves apuntes.  Teoría y práctica de la crisis Transcurridos casi cuatro años desde el comienzo de la crisis, la más severa en varias generaciones, podemos ya extraer algunas lecciones sobre la eficacia de las medidas adoptadas para restablecer la estabilidad y la solidez del sistema financiero y de la economía. Los datos confirman, desde hace varios trimestres, que ya no estamos en caída libre. La combinación de unos estímulos monetarios y fiscales extraordinarios, la provisión ilimitada de liquidez por parte de los bancos centrales, y las medidas gubernamentales dirigidas a reforzar el balance de las entidades de crédito, está contribuyendo de forma efectiva a la recuperación. Ello es especialmente cierto en Europa, aunque en algunos países, incluido el nuestro, la crisis siga enseñando su peor rostro.  Es forzoso reconocer, no obstante, que pese a los signos de recuperación, la crisis continúa y su fin no se producirá en breve. Es inmensa la riqueza financiera, física y humana destruida o dañada, y su recuperación no será posible sin emprender reformas que promuevan el trasvase de recursos humanos y materiales hacia sectores de futuro. Es la crisis más severa en varias generaciones, decía hace un instante. ¿Es esto realmente así? ¿Qué es lo que ha ocurrido? ¿Por qué ha pasado? ¿Estamos tomando las medidas necesarias para superar la crisis? ¿Y para que ésta no se repita? Son todos ellos interrogantes de una gran exigencia, pues su respuesta reclama estar en posesión de una teoría y una práctica de la crisis actual. El humor clarividente y un tanto cínico de Albert Einstein -prometo no citarle más- ayuda a aligerar un tanto la tarea. “La teoría –decía el sabio alemán- es cuando se sabe todo y nada funciona. La práctica es cuando todo funciona y nadie sabe por qué. En este caso hemos combinado la teoría y la práctica: nada funciona... y nadie sabe por qué\". Nada funciona... y nadie sabe por qué. Éste es, en la jerga un tanto pretenciosa de algunos economistas, uno de los equilibrios múltiples posibles. El equilibrio malo, ciertamente. Y, en efecto, en las semanas posteriores a la quiebra de Lehman Brothers, todo un 11-S financiero, nada funcionaba y nadie sabía por qué. Era un tiempo de “cisnes negros”, que es como Nassim Taleb denomina a aquellos acontecimientos impredecibles, de vasto impacto y consecuencias. Fueron semanas en las que todo era posible, sin que tuviéramos idea de la probabilidad de ocurrencia de los distintos escenarios, algunos de los cuales resultaban difíciles de imaginar y cuyas consecuencias para nuestra vida eran imposibles de evaluar.  La naturaleza humana tiene horror al vacío lógico; no descansa hasta racionalizar a posteriori los hechos más improbables, hasta blanquear el plumaje de tan atípico ánade. “Los hechos estaban a la vista y nadie hizo caso”, dicen algunos ávidos de reconocimiento. O el odioso “ya lo dije yo” de los aspirantes a Casandra, la mayoría de los cuáles son como esos relojes parados, que aciertan con la hora dos veces al día, sin que a ello le quepa mérito especial. Es cierto que durante los años previos a agosto de 2007, todo parecía funcionar, y creíamos que entendíamos por qué. La teoría de los mercados perfectos y completos nos explicaba el acceso generoso al crédito y la casi desaparición del riesgo financiero, y la teoría de la “gran moderación” daba una narrativa coherente a lo que algunos dieron en llamar, en alusión al cuento infantil, la “economía de ricitos de oro”: una economía con un dinamismo suficiente para crear empleo a buen ritmo, pero no excesivo, pues ello generaría inflación, contándose para evitarlo con la ayuda de los bancos centrales y con la flexibilidad creciente de los mercados. Hoy ya tenemos un diagnóstico ampliamente compartido de los porqués de la crisis. Pero antes de referirme a las causas, y sobre todo, al uso que debemos dar a este conocimiento, he de decir que, incluso sin saber con precisión el origen, la reacción de los gobiernos y los bancos centrales ante la crisis demuestra que hemos aprendido bien algunas lecciones de la depresión de los años 30, para beneficio de nuestra sociedad.   Enseñanzas de la Gran Depresión de los 30 Cuando se compara la devastación económica hoy conocida como Gran Depresión o crisis del 29 con la situación actual, es muy notable -afortunadamente para nosotros- la diferencia en el ritmo de recuperación. Las comparaciones históricas indican que el colapso de la actividad económica mundial durante el primer año de la presente crisis fue tan severo como durante la Gran Depresión, o incluso más, pero también que la recuperación se inició en una fase mucho más temprana: un año ahora frente a tres entonces. Al mismo tiempo, en la crisis actual, el derrumbe inicial del comercio mundial fue más acusado y más sincronizado que durante la Gran Depresión: casi un 30% de caída en solo cuatro meses, desde septiembre del 2008 hasta enero del 2009. Pero este dato se atempera al constatarse que la contracción del PIB y la destrucción de puestos de trabajo durante esta crisis han sido menos acusadas que en la Gran Depresión, con excepciones notables: en el caso de Alemania el desempleo ha caído, mientras que en España se ha más que doblado.  Una similitud bastante obvia entre ambas crisis es la desestabilización de los mercados financieros y de los sectores bancarios, aunque el primer signo se dio en segmentos muy diferentes: la bolsa en 1929 y el mercado de créditos hipotecarios de alto riesgo en el 2007. En ambos casos, los sistemas financieros internacionales y nacionales sufrieron graves desajustes, que dieron paso a un colapso de la actividad económica e industrial mundial.  La crisis actual presenta, sin embargo, algunas diferencias respecto a la Gran Depresión. En primer lugar, la naturaleza del colapso financiero reciente es mucho más compleja, debido a la sofisticación del sistema financiero. La aparición y desarrollo de la titulización y el modelo bancario de “originar para distribuir”, junto con la consiguiente dependencia de los bancos respecto de los mercados mayoristas de financiación, han actuado como canales de transmisión y propagación de las perturbaciones iniciales durante la crisis actual. Además, el alto grado de integración financiera internacional y la globalización explican por qué las perturbaciones financieras se han transmitido durante la crisis actual de manera más sincronizada, más rápida y más intensa que en el pasado, pero sin sufrir el efecto amplificador contractivo que en los 30 tuvo el mecanismo del patrón-oro.  Otro factor estructural que sirve para distinguir las dos etapas es la existencia, en gran parte de las economías actuales, de estabilizadores fiscales automáticos que han contribuido notablemente a atenuar el impacto macroeconómico del colapso de la actividad. Asimismo, un grado de cooperación internacional mucho más alto, en contraste con la oleada de proteccionismo de la década de los treinta, también ha tenido una influencia positiva en la crisis actual.  Dicho todo lo anterior, probablemente la principal diferencia entre las dos crisis reside en la velocidad de adopción y la envergadura de las medidas discrecionales adoptadas por las autoridades. La Gran Depresión se ha definido como un caso en el que las autoridades fracasaron en la adopción de programas para prevenir el colapso financiero. Es más, el clásico Monetary History of the United States de Milton Friedman y Anna Schwartz incide en el papel jugado por las medidas erróneas adoptadas por la Reserva Federal, como por ejemplo, la subida del tipo de interés en 1929 contra la especulación y en 1931 para defender la paridad oro-dólar, o la prematura suspensión del programa de adquisición de activos en 1932. A lo que habría que sumar la subestimación de los riesgos para la estabilidad de precios y la estabilidad financiera, consecuencia de teorías erróneas, como la tesis liquidacionista, que avaló la quiebra de los “bancos débiles” –como si en una crisis sistémica se pudiesen identificar- y una contracción masiva de la oferta monetaria y el crédito.  El siguiente mea culpa ilustra hasta qué punto han interiorizado los teóricos y los responsables de las políticas macroeconómicas las lecciones de la Gran Depresión, y en qué medida son conscientes de los riesgos de la inercia política en épocas de crisis financiera. Lo pronunció Bernanke en el 2002, con ocasión del noventa cumpleaños de Friedman: “Me gustaría decirles a Milton y Anna: en cuanto a la Gran Depresión. Tenéis razón, lo hicimos. Lo sentimos mucho. Muchísimo. Pero gracias a vosotros, no lo repetiremos”.  El despliegue de líneas de defensa Y, en efecto, no lo hemos repetido. Los bancos centrales y los gobiernos han adoptado medidas para estabilizar los mercados y la economía que no tienen precedentes históricos en cuanto a magnitud y rapidez. Otro rasgo fundamental de la respuesta a la crisis, también novedoso comparado con la experiencia de los años 30 y enormemente positivo, ha sido el alto grado de coordinación, tanto entre las autoridades nacionales, dentro de sus ámbitos de responsabilidad, como en el terreno internacional. La mejor muestra es el papel central que en la gobernanza económica mundial ha pasado a ocupar el G-20, cuyas cumbres nacieron en 2008 como una respuesta a la doble necesidad de hacer frente a la crisis financiera global y de dar en esta tarea protagonismo a las principales economías emergentes. Se puede decir sin exagerar que, al hacer frente a la crisis, las autoridades han dado lo mejor de sí mismas. La intensificación de la cooperación constituye una señal importante del compromiso de la comunidad internacional para mitigar los efectos de la crisis y afrontar sus causas de manera efectiva y duradera. Otra característica clave de las medidas de estabilización adoptadas es su vocación de temporalidad, bien diferente de la deseable permanencia de las medidas de reforma financiera, fiscal y de mercados a las que luego me referiré. La sostenibilidad de la recuperación ha pasado y pasa por aplicar con diligencia “estrategias de salida” adecuadas de lo que ha sido una respuesta de emergencia, en lo fiscal, en lo monetario y en lo financiero. Cualquier estrategia de choque prolongada en exceso convierte el remedio en algo peor que la enfermedad, y esto explica en parte los problemas que subsisten a ambos lados del Atlántico.  Pueden distinguirse principalmente tres líneas de defensa desplegadas por las autoridades contra la crisis. La primera ha consistido en el aumento de la provisión de liquidez por parte de los bancos centrales; la segunda incluye las múltiples medidas destinadas a garantizar y reforzar la estabilidad financiera; y, de modo coincidente en el tiempo, la tercera ha sido el ajuste de las políticas macroeconómicas de estímulo de la demanda agregada. Con las medidas extraordinarias de provisión de liquidez los bancos centrales trataron de que la sequía de fondos en los mercados financieros no se tradujese en un desplome del crédito. En la zona euro, el BCE puso en marcha su política de “apoyo reforzado el crédito”, consistente en ofrecer al sector bancario facilidades para refinanciarse (expansión de las garantías admitidas, alargamiento de los plazos de los préstamos, subastas de fondos a tipo de interés fijo con adjudicación plena de las pujas, financiación en dólares, y compra de cédulas, entre otras), con la finalidad no de salvar a los bancos, como equivocada o intencionadamente se dice, sino de evitar un recorte masivo de líneas de crédito que hubiera traído consigo una depresión similar a la de los años 30. En la mayoría de las economías europeas –por desgracia todavía no en la española- el crédito ya crece y los mercados se han normalizado, con la excepción del segmento de la deuda soberana en la periferia europea.  Respecto de las medidas de apoyo al sistema financiero, destinadas a contrarrestar la pérdida de confianza que siguió a la caída de gigantes financieros como Lehman Brothers o AIG y la desaparición de la banca de inversión norteamericana, éstas consistieron en garantías en la emisión de deuda bancaria, inyecciones de capital y esquemas de protección de activos, por un importe cercano a los dos billones de euros en la zona euro. La magnitud de estos apoyos, coordinados y vigilados por la Comisión Europea, siempre remunerados a favor del contribuyente y que en gran parte ya han caducado, equivale a dos veces el PIB anual español. Esta segunda línea de defensa ha evitado la implosión del sector financiero y, con ella, la del sustento de nuestras actividades básicas, pues pocas de ellas pueden sobrevivir tal como las conocemos sin el concurso del ahorro y el crédito. Y como tercera línea de defensa tenemos las extraordinarias medidas de estímulo fiscal y monetario. Los denominados estabilizadores automáticos –esto es, los aumentos de gastos como las prestaciones por desempleo, y las menores recaudaciones impositivas que acompañan a la caída de nuestros ingresos y nuestro consumo- han contribuido significativamente a la expansión fiscal. Dadas las perspectivas de una grave recesión, los gobiernos de la zona del euro decidieron reforzar el impulso presupuestario, al anunciar en otoño de 2008 una serie de medidas discrecionales coordinadas de estímulo a la actividad. Según las estimaciones de la Comisión, el impulso presupuestario representó en Europa cerca de un 5% del PIB acumulado para 2009 y 2010. Se trata de una cifra muy elevada, también en comparación con otras grandes regiones económicas. En el ámbito monetario, cabe recordar que desde el principio de la fase actual de la crisis, el BCE ha ajustado significativamente su política monetaria en respuesta a la disminución de los riesgos para la estabilidad de precios en la zona del euro. El 8 de octubre de 2008, el BCE anunció una reducción de 50 puntos básicos de su tipo de interés de referencia, en una acción coordinada con otros bancos centrales, incluida la Reserva Federal. Desde entonces, el BCE redujo los tipos en 325 puntos básicos hasta el 1%, nivel sin precedentes al que se han mantenido cerca de dos años, hasta su elevación al 1.25% el pasado abril, en respuesta a los riesgos al alza para la estabilidad de precios.  Hoy no se discute que el despliegue de líneas de defensa descrito, ha contribuido de forma efectiva a la recuperación de la economía y de la confianza, y a la suavización de las tensiones del sistema financiero. No obstante, a más largo plazo, estas medidas sólo podrán demostrar su utilidad para sentar las bases de un crecimiento y una prosperidad sostenidos si se aplican de forma consistente con los objetivos de estabilidad de precios, estabilidad financiera y sostenibilidad presupuestaria; esto es, si se entiende que las medidas adoptadas son necesariamente temporales. La política monetaria ya ha iniciado su proceso de normalización en la zona del euro, pese a que los tipos de interés a corto plazo sigan siendo muy acomodantes. Buena parte de las medidas extraordinarias de liquidez han sido ya retiradas, aunque se mantienen algunas operaciones de suministro de liquidez a tipo fijo. También son ya excepción las garantías y apoyos al sistema financiero. El reto continúa siendo el reequilibrio de las finanzas públicas, algo que tienen en común los EE.UU., el Reino Unido, Japón y algunas economías de la periferia de Europa. Y en el caso de la zona euro, estas dificultades fiscales están en la raíz de una de las paradojas más llamativas de nuestra actualidad. Porque frente al resonante éxito que ha sido el euro durante sus doce años de existencia, también es cierto que la zona euro es hoy el epicentro de las tensiones financieras a nivel global. Pero antes de referirme a este asunto, permítanme saltar sobre las líneas de defensa para encarar las causas profundas de la crisis.  ¿Qué ha ido mal? Especificidades de la crisis actual Nada funcionaba y nadie sabía por qué. Hoy la lista de damnificados es inmensa. Desde la indignación, Mario Benedetti nos decía: “Acá hay tres clases de gentes: las que se matan trabajando, las que deberían trabajar y las que tendrían que matarse”. Hoy los indignados, que incluyen en ocasiones a altos responsables políticos y sociales, señalan con el dedo: los banqueros, los mercados, el euro… Chivos expiatorios no faltan, pues el ansia de evadir responsabilidad es humana. Pero en verdad, si la indignación de Benedetti fuese una guía para la acción, aquí no quedaría casi nadie. Nada funcionaba y nadie sabía por qué. Hoy sabemos relativamente bien por qué. En realidad, lo sabemos desde otoño de 2008. Aquí falló todo. Fallaron los gobiernos y sus políticas fiscales, fallaron los bancos centrales, fallaron los supervisores y los reguladores financieros, fallaron los bancos y sus mecanismos de control, y fallaron todos los ciudadanos que, por ignorancia o avaricia, participaron con entusiasmo en la fiesta financiera e inmobiliaria, abandonando los estudios por el ladrillo, jugándose los ahorros en una lotería que siempre toca, comprando duros a peseta. Comprender lo que pasó es paso previo para actuar como se requiere para recuperar la actividad y el empleo. En la génesis de la crisis encontramos una combinación singular de factores que han afectado tanto al entorno “macro” del sistema financiero, como al comportamiento “micro” de instituciones y segmentos específicos del mercado. Pero la aparición de riesgos sistémicos de la magnitud observada en los últimos años no puede explicarse sin tener en cuenta, además, las deficiencias de la regulación financiera y la supervisión. A fines de los noventa comienzan a observarse los llamados “desequilibrios globales”. En esos años, algunas economías emergentes, principalmente asiáticas, con productividad muy dinámica pero sistemas financieros y de protección social poco desarrollados, comenzaron a acumular un exceso de ahorro y elevados superávit por cuenta corriente. Al mismo tiempo, en algunas economías avanzadas, especialmente en EE.UU., las tasas de ahorro privado cayeron fuertemente, al tiempo que el dinamismo de la innovación y la liberalización financieras facilitaban la financiación con deuda de una demanda interna en rápida expansión, lo que se tradujo en déficit crónicos por cuenta corriente. La persistencia de grandes desequilibrios financieros durante un largo período, junto con unas condiciones monetarias y fiscales relajadas en un entorno de baja inflación, fomentaron un incremento significativo del endeudamiento de las familias, las empresas y los bancos, un aumento considerable del apetito por el riesgo y una desviación creciente de los precios de las viviendas y otros activos respecto de sus valores fundamentales.  Pasando a examinar los factores microeconómicos, la causa principal de la crisis se puede encontrar en la notoria infravaloración del riesgo, en un contexto de rápida innovación financiera, lo que facilitó a la aparición de productos opacos y “sistemas bancarios en la sombra”. En el entorno macroeconómico descrito, los tipos de interés y las primas de riesgo descendieron a niveles excepcionalmente bajos en términos históricos, fomentando la “caza de rendimientos” por parte de los inversores. El sector financiero internacional respondió a la vibrante demanda de activos creando productos de creciente complejidad, y en especial, formas muy sofisticadas y poco transparentes de titulización, con riesgos difíciles de evaluar. Debido a esto, no existían mercados secundarios para muchos de los nuevos instrumentos, lo que dio lugar a riesgos de valoración y de liquidez considerables, al tiempo que la opacidad de la distribución del riesgo hizo y sigue haciendo difícil conocer y valorar las exposiciones de las entidades financieras. De esta forma, la titulización, que en principio debería haber favorecido la diversificación y la distribución del riesgo, así como economizar capital, pervirtió los incentivos de emisores, intermediarios e inversores, causando una notable relajación de los criterios para la concesión de crédito y una sorprendente concentración de riesgos en la banca. La falta de incentivos para analizar y hacer un seguimiento a los prestatarios explica que muchos inversores hayan adquirido activos de mala calidad.  Una pregunta clave es por qué estos inversores no prestaron mayor atención a los riesgos que asumían. Sin duda, éstos hicieron dejación en su obligación de análisis previo del riesgo, y confiaron excesivamente en los oráculos de las agencias de calificación, actitud a la que no han sido ajenas las regulaciones financieras. Estas agencias estaban y siguen estando sujetas a posibles conflictos de intereses que es imperativo y urgente erradicar. De igual manera, las remuneraciones y los incentivos basados en los beneficios a corto plazo tendieron a enseñorearse del sector financiero, animando la toma de un nivel de riesgo excesivo, en detrimento de la solidez a largo plazo de las instituciones financieras. Como ya se ha dicho, la explicación de la crisis financiera sería incompleta sin traer a colación las deficiencias de los marcos de regulación y supervisión. Una de las lecciones de la crisis es que, en muchos casos, los mecanismos tradicionales de supervisión han demostrado ser insuficientes para identificar a tiempo la naturaleza y la magnitud de los riesgos, así como para imponer medidas preventivas y correctoras. De hecho, a pesar de las repetidas y serias advertencias de algunas organizaciones internacionales y de algunos bancos centrales, hechas con años de adelanto al infausto verano de 2007, ni los participantes en el mercado ni buena parte de las autoridades responsables de la vigilancia de las instituciones financieras o de segmentos específicos del mercado adoptaron medidas adecuadas y suficientes. Poco pudieron hacer unas pocas Casandras frente a legiones de doctores Pangloss. Casi cuatro años de profunda crisis han confirmado la necesidad de reforzar el marco de supervisión macroprudencial del sistema financiero y su relación con el marco tradicional de supervisión de entidades, sectores y mercados. El creciente papel de los factores macrofinancieros, la intensidad de las relaciones entre mercados e instituciones, así como el elevado grado de integración financiera internacional, requieren de forma urgente un refuerzo de la normativa de supervisión macroprudencial. En este contexto, deben saber que desde enero de este año, la Unión Europea se ha dotado a sí misma del Consejo Europeo de Riesgo Sistémico (CERS), con el mandato de identificar y evaluar los riesgos para la estabilidad del sistema financiero de la Unión Europea y de emitir alertas si considera que los riesgos detectados parecen significativos. Cuando resulte apropiado, el CERS podrá complementar dichas alertas con recomendaciones sobre las medidas correctoras que convenga adoptar. Asimismo, supervisores y reguladores han de prestar más atención a los retos derivados del arbitraje regulatorio. De hecho, muchos procesos de innovación financiera y todo un sistema financiero “en la sombra” florecieron con la finalidad de eludir el cumplimiento de la normativa, y en particular, la referida a las exigencias de capital. Abordar este problema es urgente en el contexto actual, dada la importancia de las instituciones financieras multinacionales grandes y complejas que operan con diferentes regulaciones nacionales.  Ya se han realizado notables progresos en los foros internacionales en lo que respecta a identificar y aplicar las medidas correctoras necesarias. En septiembre de 2010 se alcanzó el nuevo acuerdo llamado “Basilea III”, que es un paquete de nuevas medidas de regulación sobre las exigencias de capital, definición de capital, apalancamiento y liquidez. Su plena vigencia, tras un amplio periodo de transición, contribuirá a mejorar la resistencia del sector bancario internacional y su capacidad para resistir las perturbaciones, al aumentar apreciablemente la cantidad y la calidad del capital regulatorio y de los activos líquidos. Y al mismo tiempo, se está progresando con rapidez en otros frentes, como: la introducción de un marco regulador efectivo para las instituciones sistémicamente importantes; el desarrollo de prácticas de remuneración adecuadas a la estabilidad financiera; la transparencia de las instituciones financieras, los instrumentos y los mercados que sean relevantes para la estabilidad sistémica; evitar un arbitraje regulatorio; la excesiva influencia de las agencias de calificación en los marcos de regulación; y la mejora el funcionamiento de los derivados negociados en mercados no organizados.  Hacia una “nueva normalidad” Llegados a este punto, ¿cómo se compadece tanto progreso reformador con el desempleo y el bajo crecimiento económico que aún observamos? Recordemos que el impacto inicial sobre la economía real vino de la mano del desplome de la confianza, que retrajo el consumo, la inversión, el comercio exterior y las contrataciones. A ello se sumó la pérdida de riqueza de las familias, cuyos activos, debido al pinchazo de la burbuja inmobiliaria, a la caída de los valores bursátiles, y a la disminución del crédito proporcionado por unos bancos con balances severamente dañados. La intervención de los gobiernos y los bancos centrales proporcionando impulso fiscal, tipos de interés bajos y liquidez abundante evitó la repetición de una nueva crisis de los años 30, y la medidas regulatorias que están en marcha definirán el retorno a la normalidad, una “nueva normalidad”. Nueva por varios motivos. Primero, porque necesariamente nos enfrentaremos a una mayor volatilidad macroeconómica y un menor crecimiento potencial, como ocurrió tras las crisis financieras sistémicas registradas en el pasado. Segundo, por que los sectores inmobiliario y de la construcción deberán someterse a un severo y prolongado ajuste en muchos países. Tercero, porque tanto la experiencia de esta crisis como los nuevos estándares crediticios impondrán unas valoraciones más rigurosas y conservadoras de activos e inmuebles ofrecidos como garantía del crédito. Cuarto, porque el precio de los riesgos de crédito y de liquidez se mantendrá a niveles más elevados que los absurdamente reducidos valores observados en años previos a la crisis, tanto que el riesgo llegó a desaparecer como elemento relevante en las de cisiones económicas. Quinto, porque las nuevas regulaciones sobre capital y liquidez harán a nuestro sistema financiero más resistente y estable, pero probablemente ello tenga como consecuencia un encarecimiento del coste de la intermediación financiera y, por tanto, del crédito. Y sexto, porque los bancos centrales, además de trabajar en la supervisión macroprudencial, tendrán una mayor tendencia a “remar contra el viento”, es decir, a evitar períodos de tipos de interés demasiado bajos mantenidos durante demasiado tiempo, pues hemos aprendido bien las nefastas consecuencias de estas políticas sobre el grado de fragilidad de nuestro sistema financiero. Es suma, en el “nuevo normal” el sector financiero será más pequeño en relación a la economía y más conservador en sus criterios, el crédito crecerá a ritmos más moderados que en el pasado y su coste será algo mayor. De igual forma, para alcanzar esa “nueva normalidad” los gobiernos tendrán que acometer retos difíciles, como la salida de las medidas expansionistas a gran escala, adoptadas durante la crisis para respaldar a la economía a corto plazo. A consecuencia de la formidable expansión fiscal y de la contracción de la producción, la situación fiscal se ha deteriorado en casi todos los países, en algunos casos de forma muy significativa, a ambos lados del Atlántico y a ambos lados del Canal de la Mancha. En este contexto, los mercados financieros han centrado su atención, cada vez más, en la solvencia de los estados. El saneamiento de las finanzas públicas es necesario y urgente para proteger la sostenibilidad a largo plazo y para garantizar la confianza, prerrequisito para volver a crecer y crear empleo. El ajuste presupuestario, sin embargo, sólo es una condición necesaria para la recuperación. Si miramos a nuestro alrededor comprobaremos que las economías que más rápido se están recuperando –las del centro y el norte de Europa- son aquellas que, además de una mejor situación de las finanzas públicas, tenían unos mercados de trabajo y de productos más competitivos y flexibles antes de la crisis. Flexibilidad que no equivale a precariedad, sino a capacidad de respuesta y ajuste a las nuevas condiciones sin pérdidas masivas de empleo como las que aquejan a la economía española, que amenazan el presente y el futuro de la generación más joven. Recordemos que en la primera década del euro en España se crearon unos cinco millones de empleos. De ellos algo menos de dos millones se han destruido, pero la tasa de paro se ha duplicado, hasta acercarse al 21%, tasa que sube por encima del 40% para la población más joven. Quienes se oponen a la reforma agitando el espantajo de la precariedad, nos están privando de la flexi-seguridad de sistemas como los que han permitido que en Alemania el paro haya caído durante la crisis en más de 2 puntos, hasta el 6%, o que en países como Austria y Holanda el paro se sitúe en torno al 4%.  Las perspectivas a largo plazo de un crecimiento sostenible y fuerte, tanto de la economía como del empleo, dependen en gran medida de la determinación de las autoridades para emprender reformas estructurales. En los mercados de bienes y servicios son necesarias medidas de apoyo a la competencia y la innovación. En el mercado laboral son requisitos fundamentales la moderación salarial, los incentivos para la creación de empleo a través de contratos que no disuadan de emplear a los más jóvenes, y una mayor flexibilidad para poder adaptar horas, retribuciones y otras condiciones de trabajo a la situación de las empresas. Tales reformas también facilitarán indirectamente del saneamiento presupuestario, contribuirán a hacer más resistentes nuestras economías y promoverán un aprovechamiento más eficiente del capital humano, físico y tecnológico. Es éste un imperativo urgente para economías como la nuestra, en la que la rigidez de las instituciones laborales se erige en un obstáculo insalvable para la sustancial reasignación de recursos que exige el pasado sobredimensionamiento de sectores como el financiero o el inmobiliario. En combinación con las restricciones crediticias y la tendencia a la caída de los gastos de inversión e innovación, que puede hipotecar nuestro futuro, un mercado de trabajo rígido podría retardar largos años la recuperación de los niveles de renta previos a la crisis. Primero, porque el paro coyuntural se convertiría en estructural, debido a la pérdida de empleabilidad. Segundo, porque dificultaría la sostenibilidad presupuestaria. Y tercero, porque la divergencia respecto del ciclo europeo sería penalizada ante el cambio del ciclo de tipos de interés. Tan evidente es este diagnóstico para observadores, analistas y organismos internacionales, que la morosidad en completar las reformas necesarias sorprende. Si no fuera por la gravedad del asunto, la ironía de Antonio Machado vendría al pelo. “Que dos y dos sean necesariamente cuatro es una opinión que muchos compartimos. Pero si alguien sinceramente piensa otra cosa, que lo diga. Aquí no nos asombramos de nada”.  Y es que siendo obvio lo que tenemos ante los ojos, la imagen que hoy nos devuelve el espejo de la realidad del desempleo debería ser el catalizador de las reformas necesarias. Esta es la única indignación que tiene sentido. La que exige responsabilidad a quienes retrasan o evaden su obligación de reformar el sistema financiero, para estabilizarlo y para poner coto a sus desmanes y excesos, pero también el mercado laboral y el presupuesto y las prácticas que limitan la competencia, impiden crear empleo y aumentan el coste de la vida. Esta es la única indignación que nuestra sociedad se merece.   Europa y sus paradojas Debo ir terminando, y para ello nada mejor que dar buenas noticias a aquellos que, confundidos por el ruido mediático, puedan haber caído en el “europesimismo”. “El euro no funcionará”, nos decían la prensa y la intelectualidad anglosajona a principios de los 90. “Ya se lo avisamos: el euro está en crisis”, nos dicen ahora, no sin eco en los medios continentales.  Demos un breve repaso a las cifras. Desde 1999, la inflación media ha sido inferior aunque próxima al 2 por 100 en el conjunto de la eurozona. Este ha sido, y seguirá siendo, el compromiso del BCE con su mandato. Asimismo, el BCE ha tenido una aportación destacada a la estabilidad financiera y, por esta vía, a la generación de confianza, especialmente durante la crisis. Hoy pocos discuten que, sin las medidas adoptadas por el BCE durante estos cuatro años, hoy estaríamos hablando de una depresión económica comparable a la de los años 30.  Pero si la estabilidad monetaria es imprescindible para el crecimiento y el empleo, ¿qué decir de éstos? El recuento es sencillo, acaso sorprendente para euroescépticos. Desde 1999 hasta el estallido de la crisis, el área euro creó 15 millones de empleos, el doble que los EE.UU, y redujo su tasa de paro en dos puntos hasta el 7.6%. La renta per cápita aumento casi un 14% en sólo una década, y la productividad en un 7%. Nuestra tasa de ahorro es consistentemente más del doble de la norteamericana o la británica, nuestra contribución a los desequilibrios globales nula al estar nuestras cuentas externas casi en equilibrio, y nuestras finanzas públicas, pese a las dificultades, muestran un déficit que partiendo de apenas un 1% antes de la crisis, se ha situado en 2010 en poco más del 6% del PIB, la mitad del norteamericano. No debe sorprender, con el crecimiento actual en tasas superiores al potencial y el paro por debajo del 10% y en retroceso, que el 80% de los residentes en el área euro con una opinión definida piensen, de acuerdo con el último Eurobarómetro, que el euro ha sido algo bueno. Y también se considera al euro en el mundo entero como el símbolo más exitoso del proceso de integración iniciado en Europa hace medio siglo. Así pues, no hay que echar mano de Mark Twain para concluir que los rumores sobre la muerte del euro quizás sean un tanto exagerados. Pero es innegable, al mismo tiempo, y esto es una gran paradoja, que en Europa se encuentra ahora mismo el foco más visible de tensiones financieras a nivel global: la crisis de la deuda soberana en algunos países de la periferia. Esta no es una crisis del euro. Es una crisis de confianza de los mercados –esos mercados que hoy algunos demonizan, pero a los que ayer apelaban sin tasa para evitar la impopularidad de los impuestos o la contención de los gastos- en el compromiso de algunos países con las exigencias del euro. En efecto, en 1998 cerca de trescientos millones de europeos –hoy más de trescientos treinta millones- decidimos adoptar la moneda única. Esta ambiciosa iniciativa hacía descansar sus objetivos de crecimiento económico no inflacionario y altos niveles de empleo en tres pilares: un mercado interior competitivo, basado en la eliminación de barreras a los intercambios y las reformas estructurales; unas políticas presupuestarias nacionales saneadas, coordinadas y sostenibles; y, una política monetaria orientada a la estabilidad de precios. La presente crisis de la deuda está demostrando de forma palmaria que, así como el componente monetario del euro, a cargo del BCE y el Eurosistema, ha funcionado incluso mejor que las monedas más sólidas que pasaron a integrarse en el euro, la adaptación de las políticas fiscales y de las reformas estructurales a las nuevas exigencias de la moneda única ha sido insuficiente. Algunos gobiernos parecen no haber interiorizado las exigencias del euro para el desarrollo de su política económica, y han actuado como si las pérdidas de competitividad y la vulnerabilidad fiscal pudiesen enjugarse todavía mediante el tradicional recurso a la inflación y la devaluación. Pero éstas –inflación y devaluación- son las naves que, conscientemente, decidimos quemar con la creación del euro.  Y tampoco ha funcionado bien el marco de coordinación de las políticas fiscales, por no hablar de la total ausencia de coordinación de políticas macroeconómicas con impacto en la competitividad. Han sido la crisis griega y su contagio a otros países vulnerables la prueba irrefutable: no importa cuán pequeño sea el país, que sus problemas de competitividad y sus desequilibrios pueden tener un impacto sistémico. Por eso los desequilibrios graves en las finanzas públicas y en la competitividad deben prevenirse, mediante una gobernanza europea reforzada, y corregirse a través de políticas nacionales coordinadas y mecanismos que penalicen la falta de diligencia. Este es el Pacto por el Euro. Aunque no pueda decir con seguridad cuándo saldremos de esta crisis, tengo razones para pensar que saldremos fortalecidos si no nos abandonamos a la inacción o a la indignación que sólo busca chivos expiatorios. Son tiempos difíciles, pero quiero recordarles que Europa se ha forjado siempre en las crisis. De las aspiraciones de paz y progreso de la posguerra surgieron las Comunidades Europeas. Más recientemente, de la crisis del Sistema Monetario Europeo 1992-1993 surgieron el Instituto Monetario Europeo en 1994, el predecesor del BCE, y un fuerte impulso de integración económica. De aquella aguda crisis surgió el euro, que tantos beneficios ha proporcionado desde 1999 y que hoy nos protege de turbulencias más severas.  Nos encontramos hoy en una encrucijada histórica para el futuro del euro. Un momento crítico que demanda de todos lucidez, energía y compromiso. Lucidez para comprender que la política fiscal difícilmente sostenible de un país miembro del euro tiene efectos perniciosos sobre el resto, en términos de contagio y de pérdida de confianza. Y para entender que las pérdidas continuadas de competitividad de un país son inviables.  También es necesaria la lucidez para comprender que el futuro de nuestra moneda única pasa por un salto cualitativo en su gobernanza, ya que tanto las políticas fiscales como el funcionamiento de los mercados de trabajo, de bienes y de servicios son materias de interés común. Y, como tales, deben sujetarse –dentro de la autonomía de los países- a criterios de coordinación y disciplina efectivos, en un nuevo marco de supervisión recíproca y actuación preventiva disuasorias de las políticas nacionales que pongan en riesgo el interés común de los países miembros.  Y a la lucidez le deberán seguir la energía para actuar, tanto más necesaria y urgente cuanto mayores sean las vulnerabilidades fiscales y las rigideces estructurales, y un renovado compromiso con Europa. En medio de las dificultades de ahora no debemos olvidar que el euro es nuestro destino en común. La crisis actual y la experiencia histórica contienen una enseñanza: el euro no ha dejado de proporcionar beneficios, en términos de estabilidad macroeconómica y financiera, y lo ha hecho especialmente durante los episodios más agudos de tensión financiera. Acelerar los cambios necesarios para fortalecer este proyecto vivo es la gran responsabilidad de todos –gobiernos, Comisión, Consejo y Parlamento europeos- en esta hora crucial de la construcción europea. La Historia ha confirmado en repetidas ocasiones la clarividencia de las palabras de Jean Monnet: “Los hombres no aceptan el cambio sino en la necesidad, y no ven la necesidad más que en la crisis”, nos decía. Estoy convencido de, si se entiende la urgencia y se abandonan los particularismos, Europa puede emerger de la crisis más fuerte y con un peso mayor en el mundo, como lo hizo con la creación del euro. Quisiera terminar mis palabras con este mensaje de confianza.  '],\n",

       " {'ECB': ['  Anpassungsmechanismen in der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion   Rede von Jürgen Stark, Mitglied des Direktoriums der EZB,DIE WELT Währungskonferenz „Unsere Währung und die Zukunft in Europe“Berlin, 27. Juni 2011  Anpassungsmechanismen in der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion Die aktuelle Krise können nur die Regierungen der Mitgliedsstaaten durch konsequentes Handeln beheben. Die fiskalischen und makroökonomischen Ungleichgewichte, die mit einer Erosion der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit einiger Länder des Euroraums einhergingen, müssen korrigiert werden. Dies ist Grundvoraussetzung dafür, dass die Währungsunion reibungslos funktionieren kann.  Solche Ungleichgewichte bergen erhebliche Risiken für die Währungsunion. Daher wird gegenwärtig über ein wirksames integriertes Regelwerk zur engeren wirtschaftlichen Überwachung der Mitgliedsländer verhandelt, das übermäßige wirtschaftliche Ungleichgewichte in Zukunft verhindern soll. Zudem wurde ein breit angelegter Reformprozess zur Stärkung des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts initiiert. Die EZB begrüßt diese Schritte, hält aber eine weitere Verschärfung der Maßnahmen erforderlich. Die Anpassungsmechanismen in einer Währungsunion unterscheiden sich in wichtigen Merkmalen von denen, die einem Land mit festen, aber anpassungsfähigen Wechselkursen – wie zum Beispiel im Europäischen Wechselkursmechanismus II – zur Verfügung stehen. Wenn ein Land mit nominell festen Wechselkursen über eine gewisse Zeit hinweg höheres Wachstum bei den Lohnstückkosten und im Ergebnis auch stärkere Inflation erfährt, kann es den damit verbundenen Verlust an preislicher Wettbewerbsfähigkeit durch eine nominale Abwertung wieder korrigieren. In einer Währungsunion besteht diese Möglichkeit nicht. Gleichwohl muss auch in diesem Fall eine reale Abwertung bewirkt werden, das heißt eine Reduzierung des heimischen Kosten- und Preisniveaus relativ zu denen im Ausland, oder eine kompetitive Disinflation.  Wettbewerbsfähigkeit kann in einer Währungsunion somit nur durch dauerhaft hohe Produktivitätszuwächse bei flexiblen Preisen und Löhnen erreicht werden. Starke Verluste der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und ein hohes Niveau der Arbeitslosigkeit erfordern Phasen der Lohnzurückhaltung, gegebenenfalls auch Nominallohnsenkungen. Zudem müssen anpassungsfähige – qualifikatorische, sektorale und regionale – Lohnstrukturen für ein ausreichend hohes Maß an Lohndifferenzierung sorgen. Die dazu erforderlichen institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen sind bisher in den Euroländern nicht hinreichend erfüllt und Reformen mit dem Ziel, die Anpassungsfähigkeit der Volkswirtschaften zu erhöhen, sind absolut erforderlich.  In vielen Ländern gilt es, die Arbeitsmärkte zu flexibilisieren, in dem der Lohnfindungsprozess dezentralisiert, Lohnindexierungssysteme abgebaut und diskriminierende Mindestlohnregelungen reformiert werden. Außerdem muss der Wettbewerb auf den Gütermärkten intensiviert werden um strukturelle Veränderungen voranzutreiben, die insbesondere die Länder, deren Wachstum sich vor der Krise auf den Bau- und Immobiliensektor stützte, dringend benötigen. Darüber hinaus helfen Strukturreformen, die das langfristige Wachstum stärken, die überhöhten Schuldenstände der öffentlichen und privaten Haushalte tragbarer zu machen und damit die Nachhaltigkeit der Fiskalpolitik zu gewährleisten.  Zur Zeit ist die Situation aber in einigen Euro-Mitgliedsländern derart aus dem Ruder gelaufen, dass die Rückkehr zu einem nachhaltigen Wachstumspfad und zu einer tragfähigen Haushaltspolitik nur durch die entschlossene Umsetzung weit reichender wirtschafts- und haushaltspolitischer Anpassungsprogramme erzielt werden kann. Dies haben die Länder mit der Europäischen Kommission, der Europäischen Zentralbank und dem Internationalen Währungsfonds vereinbart. Im Detail berücksichtigen diese Programme sehr genau die jeweiligen Umstände und Problemlagen in diesen Ländern. Sie orientieren sich jedoch alle an den soeben beschriebenen wirtschaftspolitischen Voraussetzungen der Mitgliedschaft in einer Währungsunion. Sie zielen – neben einer Konsolidierung der öffentlichen Finanzen – klar auf die Stärkung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und des Wachstumspotenzials. Die Anpassungsprogramme sind ökonomisch überzeugend: wenn sie konsequent umgesetzt werden, werden sie zu höheren Wachstumsraten, mehr Beschäftigung und einer Rückführung der öffentlichen Verschuldung führen. Ohne Strukturreformen wird die Anpassungsrezession noch schärfer verlaufen. Es ist aber unsicher, wann genau sich Erfolge in Form von dauerhaft höherem Wachstum und höherer Beschäftigung einstellen werden. Die Maßnahmen benötigen Zeit um zu wirken. Die vereinbarten Strategien erfordern Geduld und Standfestigkeit in der Umsetzung. Ganz wichtig ist, dass alle politischen Kräfte in den betroffenen Ländern in dieser Phase eines nationalen Notstands vereint an einem Strang ziehen, sich mit besonderem Engagement hinter die Programme stellen, die Bürger mit auf den zunächst schwierigen Weg mitnehmen und sie von der Notwendigkeit der Anpassungsprogramme überzeugen.  In der gegenwärtigen Situation stehen den Krisenländern keine sinnvollen und besseren Alternativen offen. Das Argument, die Anpassungsprogramme seien zu rigoros, lassen insbesondere solche Länder nicht gelten, die selbst durch ähnliche Krisen gegangen sind. Im Exekutiv-Direktorium des IWF beklagen sich die Vertreter der Schwellenländer, dass ihnen in den späten 1990er Jahren und um die Jahrtausendwende zur Bewältigung ihrer Krisen härtere Konditionen abverlangt wurden. Wenn Europa zur Lösung seiner internen Probleme den IWF als Feuerwehr benötigt, dann müssen wir auch internationale Standards gelten lassen!  Eine Umschuldung, wie sie im Falle Griechenlands offen diskutiert wird, stellt absolut keine Alternative dar. Wir haben schon zu einem sehr frühen Zeitpunkt ausdrücklich vor den negativen Folgen einer solchen Maßnahme gewarnt. Genauer gesagt raten wir eindringlich von einer Lösung für die Haushaltskrise in Griechenland ab, die (1) ein Kreditereignis (einem Zahlungsausfall, durch den Kreditausfallversicherungen fällig würden) darstellen würde, die (2) zu einer Bonitätseinstufung von selective default oder schlechter führen würde oder (3) die jedweden Zwang auf private Gläubiger ausüben würde. In der Öffentlichkeit wurde die Frage aufgeworfen, ob die EZB hinsichtlich einer Umschuldung in Griechenland deshalb so unnachgiebig ist, weil wir Schaden von unseren Geschäftsbüchern abwenden wollen. Die Antwort ist ein klares „Nein“.  Die Risiken, die die EZB im Rahmen ihrer Offenmarktgeschäfte und ihrer geldpolitischen Sondermaßnahmen eingegangen ist, sind beherrschbar. Zu keinem Zeitpunkt haben oder werden diese Entscheidungen die Handlungsfähigkeit oder die Unabhängigkeit der Europäischen Zentralbank in Frage stellen. Unsere Position basiert auf dem klaren Grundsatz, dass der Souverän als Gläubiger für seine Schulden einstehen muss. Wer handelt, haftet. Dieser Grundsatz ergibt sich schon aus dem Prinzip der Rechtsstaatlichkeit, also dem Fundament moderner Demokratien. Dieser Grundsatz verhindert aber auch die Entstehung von Fehlanreizen, insbesondere in einer Währungsunion. Die Möglichkeit eines Schuldenschnitts untergräbt den Anreiz für Staaten, die Tragfähigkeit ihrer öffentlichen Haushalte wieder herzustellen.  Außerdem gehen von einer Umschuldung in einem Mitgliedsstaat des Euroraums kurzfristig schwerwiegende Gefahren für die wirtschaftliche Stabilität des Landes und die Finanzstabilität im Euroraum als Ganzes aus. Erstens müssten griechische Banken im Fall einer Umstrukturierung Abschreibung vornehmen, die ihre Solvenz gefährden könnte. Außerdem würden, wie Sie wissen, Ratingagenturen im Fall einer Umschuldung oder gar eines haircuts die Bonität Griechenlands herabstufen. In diesem Fall könnte das Eurosystem die Staatsanleihen des betroffenen Souveräns nicht weiter als Sicherheit akzeptieren und viele Banken in Griechenland stünden vor einem Refinanzierungsengpass. Im Fall einer Bankenkrise wären weitere, negative Folgen für die griechische Volkswirtschaft nicht zu verhindern. Eine Herabstufung der Banken und des privaten Sektors generell würden große Risiken für die Kreditvergabe an den privaten Sektor und somit auch für Wachstum und Beschäftigung in Griechenland bergen. Zweitens wären die Auswirkungen einer Bankenkrise nicht auf Griechenland beschränkt. Innerhalb des Eurogebiets sind die Finanzmärkte stark miteinander verflochten.  Drittens hätte eine Umschuldung in Griechenland verheerende Folgen für die Haushaltssituation anderer Staaten des Euroraums. Aus Angst vor weiteren Kreditausfällen im Euroraum könnte es zum Ausverkauf von Staatsanleihen anderer Eurostaaten kommen. Dies würde natürlich insbesondere die Länder treffen, die derzeit Schwierigkeiten haben, sich am Markt zu finanzieren.  Kurzum: Die Auswirkungen einer Umschuldung für die Stabilität des Finanzmarktsystems in Europa sind nicht absehbar und könnten die Auswirkungen der Lehman-Insolvenz noch in den Schatten stellen. Jeder der etwas anderes behauptet, verkennt die Komplexität der Situation. Schließlich würden mit einer Umschuldung die zugrunde liegenden Haushaltsprobleme Griechenlands nicht nachhaltig gelöst. Solange der Haushalt des griechischen Staates ein großes Primärdefizit aufweist, würde ein Schuldenschnitt die Schuldentragfähigkeit nur vorübergehend verbessern. Sofort wegfallen würde jedoch der politische Druck auf die griechische Regierung, ihre Bemühungen zu intensivieren, Haushaltsdefizite abzubauen und durch Strukturreformen die Wirtschaft wieder wettbewerbsfähig zu machen. Daher ist die schnelle und uneingeschränkte Umsetzung der Anpassungsprogramme, die die Krisenländer mit der EU und dem IWF ausgehandelt haben, der beste Weg aus der gegenwärtigen Krise. Allerdings: alle Mitgliedsstaaten müssen ihre Hausaufgaben machen und ihre Haushalts- und Wirtschaftspolitik auf einen nachhaltigen Kurs bringen. Nur so können sie das Wachstumspotential ihrer Volkswirtschaften stärken und die Vorteile, die ihnen die Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion bietet, voll nutzen. Die Verantwortung für die weitere Entwicklung im Eurogebiet liegt jetzt ausschließlich bei Griechenland. Bei den Maßnahmen, die die Troika auf Expertenebene mit dem griechischen Finanzministerium ausgehandelt hat, darf es kein Zurückrudern geben. Nur auf der Basis einer glaubwürdigen mittelfristigen Konsolidierungsstrategie und eines ehrgeizigen Privatisierungskonzepts kann Griechenland auf die Auszahlung der nächsten Tranche hoffen. Solidarität darf nicht in der Weise missverstanden werden, dass die europäischen Partner und die internationale Gemeinschaft keine andere Wahl hätten, als die Finanzierung fortzusetzen. Niemand ist erpressbar und niemand darf erpressbar sein.  Zentralbankunabhängigkeit und geldpolitische Maßnahmen der EZB Im Zusammenhang mit unseren geldpolitischen Maßnahmen habe ich die Unabhängigkeit der EZB bereits kurz erwähnt. Ich möchte auf diese Frage etwas näher eingehen. Insbesondere in Deutschland wird eine Diskussion über unser Handeln geführt und die Frage aufgeworfen, ob die EZB zu weit gegangen sei bei der Interpretation des Mandats und der Wahl der Maßnahmen. Wie Sie wissen, treffen wir unsere geldpolitischen Entscheidungen vollständig unabhängig von politischer Einflussnahme, allein unserem Mandat verpflichtet, das Preisniveau im Euroraum als Ganzes dauerhaft stabil zu halten. Das ist nicht nur ausdrücklich vertraglich festgelegt, sondern auch eine wichtige Lehre aus der Währungsgeschichte. Es besteht heute weitgehend Konsens darüber, dass eine umfassend unabhängige Notenbank die conditio sine qua non für eine glaubwürdige Geldpolitik ist. Letztlich geht es darum, die Regierungen vor sich selbst zu schützen. Zu groß ist die Versuchung, mittelfristig stabile Preise auf dem Altar kurzfristiger Wahltaktik zu opfern. Dies schadet nicht nur der Glaubwürdigkeit und Durchschlagskraft der Geldpolitik. Es wirkt auch negativ auf Wohlstand und Beschäftigung. Eine Krise, zumal mit der derzeitigen beispiellosen Dimension, stellt die Geldpolitik vor große Herausforderungen. Brechen sowohl globale und inländische Nachfrage zusammen, können schnell äußerst schädliche, deflationäre Preisentwicklungen auftreten. Gleichzeitig können die Transmissionsmechanismen der Geldpolitik in einer Finanzkrise gestört werden und die Handlungsfähigkeit der Zentralbank empfindlich einschränken. Besonders problematisch ist eine Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise für eine Zentralbank jedoch dann, wenn der fiskalpolitische Spielraum der Regierung ausgeschöpft ist. Schon in wirtschaftlich guten Zeiten sind Regierungen umso mehr an einer Abkehr vom Primat der Preisstabilität und an steigender Inflation interessiert, je drückender die Last der Staatsschulden ist, lassen sich die Schulden doch so vermeintlich einfach real reduzieren. In einer Krisensituation kann aber sogar die Zentralbankunabhängigkeit in Gefahr geraten.  Insbesondere kann in dieser Situation der politische Druck auf die Zentralbank zunehmen, die Krisenbewältigung vor das Ziel der Preisstabilität zu stellen. In einer Volkswirtschaft mit einer unabhängigen Zentralbank, die der Preisstabilität verpflichtet ist, fällt es primär der Regierung zu, Konjunkturzyklen und akuten Wirtschaftskrisen mit fiskalischen und anderen wirtschaftspolitischen Instrumenten entgegenzuwirken. Kann eine Regierung ihre Ausgaben jedoch nicht mehr ohne weiteres an den Kapitalmärkten finanzieren, ist die Versuchung groß, die Geldpolitik zu konjunkturpolitischen Zwecken zu missbrauchen. Wo immer in der Vergangenheit die Zentralbank „missbraucht“ wurde, um Haushaltslöcher zu stopfen, gingen damit erhebliche Gefahren für die Stabilität der Währung einher. Nicht selten gingen Währungen unter. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es elementar wichtig, dass wir im EZB-Rat auch weiterhin all unsere Entscheidungen unabhängig treffen, unsere Stabilitätsorientierung beibehalten und politischem Druck nicht nachgeben. So haben wir uns Anfang 2004 den Forderungen nach Zinssenkungen aus Deutschland, Frankreich und Italien verweigert, weil wir zu dieser Zeit unsere geldpolitische Ausrichtung als angemessen hielten, stabile Preise zu gewährleisten und dabei gleichzeitige die wirtschaftliche Erholung zu unterstützen. Wir haben auch nicht gezögert, die Leitzinsen im Dezember 2005 zu erhöhen, als fast alle Regierungen im Euroraum und viele internationale Beobachter auf unveränderte Zinsen gedrungen haben. Diese hielten wir seinerzeit für angezeigt, weil wir Aufwärtsrisiken für die Preisstabilität in der mittleren Frist sahen. Und wir haben unsere Unabhängigkeit während der aktuellen Krise bewiesen.  Die EZB hat seinerzeit, als sich die Finanzkrise durch den Zusammenbruch von Lehman Brothers intensivierte, rasch und entschieden auf die globale Krise und den damit verbundenen abnehmenden Inflationsdruck reagiert. Wir haben den Leitzins von Oktober 2008 und Mai 2009 – also innerhalb von nur sieben Monaten – um 325 Basispunkte auf 1% gesenkt und auf diesem Niveau für nahezu zwei Jahren belassen. Dieses historisch niedrige Niveau war zum Höhepunkt der Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise angemessen, muss aber nun im Zuge der wirtschaftlichen Erholung und der anziehenden Teuerungsrate angepasst werden. Hiermit haben wir im April begonnen. Wir sind sehr wachsam, und werden alles tun, um die Stabilität des Euro auch in Zukunft zu gewährleisten und die Inflationserwartungen auf niedrigem Niveau zu verankern.  Im Rahmen der Krise haben wir zudem eine Reihe von zeitlich begrenzten geldpolitischen Sondermaßnahmen getroffen. Dazu gehört die unbegrenzte Bereitstellung von Zentralbankliquidität zu einem festen Zinssatz und gegen angemessene Sicherheiten in all unseren Refinanzierungsgeschäften. Zudem haben wir Programme für die Wertpapiermärkte eingeführt. Diese Maßnahmen waren aus geldpolitischer Sicht notwendig um sicherzustellen, dass unsere Zinspolitik auch auf die Finanzierungsbedingungen und Kreditströme im Euroraum übertragen und Ansteckungen innerhalb einzelner Finanzmarktsegmente verhindern werden.  Der EZB-Rat hat somit aus guten Gründen im Rahmen seines Krisenmanagements unkonventionelle Maßnahmen getroffen. Wir haben unbekanntes Terrain betreten, da die Lehrbücher uns nicht weiter helfen konnten. Das hat unter anderem zur Folge, dass wir unsere Bilanz beträchtlich ausgeweitet haben und dabei vermehrt Risiken übernommen haben. All dies ist aber vor dem Hintergrund der Schwere der Krise zu sehen. Die globale Wirtschaftskrise war die stärkste seit 1929. Die aktuelle Schuldenkrise stellt die schwerste Belastungsprobe für die Währungsunion dar. Diese historischen Dimensionen rechtfertigen unsere außergewöhnlichen Schritte.  Hat die EZB im Rahmen ihrer Sondermaßnahmen übermäßig Risiken übernommen? In einer Finanzkrise ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass die Zentralbank Liquidität im ausreichenden Maße bereitstellt, vor allem wenn von einzelnen Marktteilnehmern ein systemisches Risiko ausgeht. Eine Zentralbank kann sich hier ihrer Verantwortung als letztinstanzlicher Kreditgeber – als Lender of Last Resort – nicht entziehen. Würde sie sich dem versagen, dürfte das Risiko für die Volkswirtschaft insgesamt extrem steigen. Es könnte zu einem Run auf die Banken kommen und die Realwirtschaft könnte in eine anhaltende Depression abgleiten. Eine systemische Finanzkrise würde fast unumgänglich Rückwirkungen auf die Preisstabilität haben. Diese Risiken sind wesentlich höher einzustufen, als das Risiko, die mit einer Ausweitung der Bilanz des Eurosystems einhergeht, auch wenn sich nun die Risiken des Eurosystems gegenüber Banken in den Ländern, die verstärkt von der Schuldenkrise betroffen sind, erhöht hat. Hierbei ist zu beachten, das wir Liquidität nur an finanziell solide Kreditinstitute zur Verfügung stellen, und, gemäß unserem Statut, dies auch nur gegen „ausreichende Sicherheiten“. Zu dem betreiben wir ein sehr umfangreiches und konservatives Risikomanagement, das die Risiken überschaubar hält. Dies gewährleistet die finanzielle Unabhängigkeit des Eurosystems.  Zentralbanken und Regierungen fortgeschrittener Volkswirtschaften haben durch ihr Handeln eine Kernschmelze des globalen Finanzsystems und eine wirtschaftliche Depression vermieden. Ein auf mittelfristige Preisstabilität ausgerichtete Geldpolitik erfordert es, dass die Sondermaßnahmen allmählich auslaufen. Sie sind – wie bereits erwähnt – ohnehin temporärer Natur und nur so lange gerechtfertigt, wie außergewöhnliche Umstände es erfordern. Einige der geldpolitischen Sondermaßnahmen wurden bereits zurückgeführt. Die Lage am Interbankenmarkt hat sich zudem erheblich entspannt, was sich in einem geringeren Rückgriff auf unsere Refinanzierungsgeschäfte ausdrückt. So ist das Volumen aller EZB-Refinanzierungsoperationen von nahezu 900 Milliarden Euro im Juni 2010 auf knapp 500 Milliarden Euro in der vergangenen Woche und damit nahezu auf Vorkrisenstand gesunken.  Als Antwort auf den offenen Ausbruch der Staatsschuldenkrise und einen gestörten Preisfindungsmechanismus an bestimmen Anleihemärkten hat die EZB im Mai letzten Jahres das Programm für die Wertpapiermärkte aufgenommen. Es beinhaltet den zeitlich begrenzten Kauf von Wertpapieren am Sekundärmarkt. Dies hat uns den Vorwurf gebracht, wir würden die Haushalte der Mitgliedsstaaten des Euroraums finanzieren.  Ein solcher Vorwurf geht an der Sache vorbei. Der Kauf von Wertpapieren durch die EZB zielt allein darauf ab, den geldpolitischen Transmissionsmechanismus aufrechtzuerhalten. Die Anleihemärkte, insbesondere für Staatsanleihen, spielen nämlich eine wichtige Rolle für die Transmission des geldpolitischen Impulses. Das Programm ist damit rein geldpolitisch motiviert. Es dient nicht der Finanzierung von Staatsdefiziten. Dies ist uns durch den Maastricht-Vertrag – aus gutem Grund und mit Blick auf die Erfahrungen in dieser Hinsicht – explizit verboten. Noch einmal: Wir haben mit unseren Entscheidungen immer im Rahmen unseres Mandats gehandelt, um mittelfristig Preisstabilität im Euroraum zu gewährleisten. Und wir werden weiterhin eine stabilitätsorientierte Politik für den gesamten Euroraum verfolgen und dabei unsere Unabhängigkeit – in jeglicher Hinsicht – bewahren: persönlich, finanziell, institutionell.  Schluss Auf dieser Währungskonferenz geht es um unsere Währung und um Europa. Die Diskussion muss jedoch den breiteren Kontext berücksichtigen: die Rolle Europas und des Eurogebiets im Verhältnis zu anderen Regionen der Welt. Die Weltfinanz- und Wirtschaftskrise wird ihre Spuren überall hinterlassen. Es sind die richtigen Lehren zu ziehen. In Europa befinden wir uns noch mitten in der Krise:   Es ist keine Währungskrise, keine Krise des Euro   Aber es ist eine hausgemachte Krise – eine Krise der Staatsfinanzen, die in eine Staatskrise einmünden kann, wenn nicht entschlossen gehandelt wird. Dann gäbe es Verwerfungen auch im Eurogebiet.   Eine Krise der europäischen Integration und des institutionellen Rahmens.   Die Schwere und Dauer der Krise sowie das Krisenmanagement der Regierungen haben Skepsis gegenüber „Europa“, der europäischen Integration und gegenüber dem Euro genährt. Die Akzeptanz Europas und des Euro leidet. Ich halte die Infragestellung des Nutzens und die Refokussierung auf den „nationalen Vorteil“ der Integration für extrem gefährlich. So wäre Europa über die letzen 60 Jahre nicht vorangebracht worden. Wo stünden wir heute ohne die historischen Fortschritte in der Einigung Europas?   Ohne gemeinsame Politiken?   Ohne gemeinsamen Binnenmarkt, ohne die Freiheit des grenzüberschreitenden Personen-, Waren- und Kapitalverhaltens?   Ohne gemeinsame Währung?   Der Euro ist eine stabile Währung, nach innen und nach außen. Seit der Euroeinführung sind die Preise im gesamten Euroraum jahresdurchschnittlich nur um 2% gestiegen, der durchschnittliche Preisanstieg in Deutschland ist mit 1,5% in diesem Zeitraum sogar noch geringer ausgefallen. Zudem ist der Euro eine von internationalen Anlegern begehrte Währung. Auch wenn kein Grund zur Selbstgefälligkeit besteht, der Stabilitätserfolg des Euro ist unbestreitbar. Es gibt keinen Grund zur Selbstgefälligkeit in Deutschland. Weder in der Politik noch an den Stammtischen.   Die Bedeutung und die Vorteile der europäischen Integration werden in der deutschen öffentlichen Diskussion unterschätzt.   Auch Deutschland hatte seine Probleme mit den Arbeitsmarktreformen und der Rückgewinnung seiner Wettbewerbsfähigkeit.   Nicht zu vergessen, dass die so genannte „Reform“ des Stabilitätspakts auf deutsche (und französische) Initiative zurückging. Zum Teil sind heutige Probleme auf die Aufweichung der Haushaltsregeln 2003-2005 zurückzuführen.   Ebenfalls nicht zu vergessen: die Finanzkrise ist 2007 von den USA ausgehend auf dem europäischen Kontinent zuerst in Deutschland aufgeschlagen. Es war eine deutsche Bank, die als erstes auf dem Kontinent „gerettet“ wurde.   Das deutsche Bankensystem hat direkt oder indirekt von unseren unkonventionellen Maßnahmen profitiert. Ohne unsere Liquiditätsmaßnahmen hätte es auch in Deutschland ein systemisches Risiko gegeben. Dafür lässt man sich ungern als „Bad Bank“ apostrophieren.    Wir haben verantwortungsvoll gehandelt – und wir sind Risiken eingegangen in der schwersten Krise seit Menschengedenken. Und natürlich haften wir für unser Handeln. Im Gegensatz zu unseren Kritikern und öffentlichen Ratgebern sind wir für unser Tun rechenschaftspflichtig gegenüber mehr als 330 Millionen Bürgerinnen und Bürgern, die den Euro täglich als ihr stabiles Geld benutzen. Vergessen wir auch nicht, Europa, so wie wir es heute haben, ist die auf Integration beruhende europäische Friedensordnung, die es zu sichern und weiterzuentwickeln gilt.  '],\n",
       "  'FED': ['  Press briefing on new monetary and financial statistics   Introductory remarks by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, for the presentation of four new/enhanced datasets on monetary and financial statistics, Frankfurt, 27 June 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to this press briefing on monetary and financial statistics, which is dedicated to the presentation of two new and two extended sets of statistics. We are in an environment of continuous financial innovations and changes in the financial landscape. The ECB is determined to keep the monetary and financial statistics fit for use in that changing environment.  The extended sets of statistics improve the existing balance sheet and interest rate reporting by “monetary financial institutions”, which means primarily banks representing the money-issuing sector. These datasets are at the centre of our monetary analysis.  The new statistics refer to detailed quarterly balance sheet information from financial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation, often called securitisation vehicles, and from insurance corporations and pension funds. The new datasets close some gaps in the harmonised balance sheet reporting of the growing sector of euro area financial intermediaries outside the money issuing sector.  These improvements and new developments are the result of very significant efforts undertaken by statisticians at the ECB and in the national central banks of the Eurosystem. The work was carried out in close collaboration with policy-makers, analysts and the financial industry. In my view, this process brought about a proper balance between the benefits of the data for monetary policy and the burden of collecting it from respondents. As policy-makers, we need timely data, and the data must be harmonised across country borders, so that it can be readily aggregated at the euro area level.  The new statistics fit in well with the much used term “lessons learned from the financial crisis”. At the same time, the new developments are the outcome of a process that has been pursued pro-actively and with a longer-term view, rather than re-actively and with a focus on the recent crisis. Indeed, the development process started before the financial turmoil that escalated into a genuine crisis. The process involved the euro area as well as other EU countries. It was motivated by the need to fill gaps caused by the ongoing financial innovation and by structural changes within financial products and the financial sector. The analysis forming the basis for monetary policy decisions depends crucially on the quality and breadth of coverage of the available statistics. Not least the frequently cited deficiencies of the Greek statistical system (with respect to both methodological and institutional aspects) have reminded us of the importance of reliable, accurate and timely statistics for the functioning and credibility of our whole system. I am pleased that the new developments in monetary and financial statistics will contribute, in particular, to the research agenda of the ECB’s Governing Council for enhancing monetary analysis. As you know, the ECB attaches a high importance to this. Last year, we published a comprehensive scientific compendium on the enhancement of monetary analysis, and I presented these results at a press briefing.[1] Allow me to mention three key examples to illustrate the improvements the new data bring. First, the new data will shed more light into the relatively opaque shadow banking. A major aspect of financial innovation is linked to the securitisation of financial assets by, in particular, the banking sector, and to the financial vehicles created outside the banking sector for this purpose. The lack of good statistical information on securitisation gained increasing relevance over the last decade and became particularly obvious in the financial crisis.  In order to provide for a consistent monitoring of securitisation, the ECB has now introduced new quarterly balance sheet statistics that cover “financial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation”. The aggregated total assets of such special-purpose vehicles in the euro area stood at €2.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2011. This represents about one tenth of the total assets of all non-bank financial intermediaries. And together with the reporting of investment funds established in 2009, which also includes hedge funds, the ECB statistics now cover a large part of the shadow banking system within the euro area. In addition to balance sheet reporting for securitisation vehicles, a consistent monthly reporting by Monetary and Financial Institutions (MFIs) has also been developed. This makes it possible to assess how the securitisation of loans granted by MFIs can actually have an impact on the growth rates of MFI lending to households and non-financial corporations. That is a step forward for our monetary analysis. To give you a concrete example: taking into account the impact of securitisation, the annual growth of MFI loans to non-financial corporations turned positive already in October 2010, some months ahead of what had been shown by the figures available in the previous version of the statistics. Second, we now have detailed quarterly data on the balance sheet of insurance corporations and pension funds. Currently, their assets account for about one third of all assets of non-bank financial intermediaries within the euro area. That is of course already a sizeable figure, but in view of our ageing societies, those institutions can be expected to be of further increasing significance for the economy and the entire financial system. Already today, insurance and pension fund technical reserves, which represent the claims that households have vis-à-vis life insurance companies and pension plans (other than social insurance schemes), account for around 30% of households’ total financial wealth. These new data therefore are important not only for the ECB, but will be highly relevant for many other uses.  Furthermore, as institutional investors with a significant portfolio in securities, insurance corporations and pension funds will be monitored for monetary policy and financial stability purposes. In view of the desirable further development of these statistics, we have started a close cooperation with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). This should help to further improve the statistics, while minimising the costs for the industry through the compilation of aggregated data based on supervisory returns. Third, the improved interest rate statistics allow a deeper analysis of the transmission channels of monetary policy. One specific improvement sheds more light on how the external financing conditions of small and medium-sized non-financial enterprises compare with those of large corporations. This is particularly relevant for the euro area, given its rather more bank-based funding system as compared with the more market-based funding system in the United States.  For example, figures on interest rates for new loans to non-financial corporations show that interest rates on new loans of up to €250,000 have indeed been far higher than interest rates on loans of over €1 million. On average, they were more than 140 basis points higher for small and medium-sized enterprises and 90 basis points higher for sole proprietors. This is important information which enhances our analysis of the financing conditions as these rates serve as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as to “sole proprietors” (e.g. doctors or architects). Overall, I am pleased to see that these new developments and the new datasets in the euro area monetary and financial statistics keep them fit for policy and analysis purposes. Actually, we are coping well with the current challenges. In particular, not least due to the specific role we assign to money in our monetary policy strategy, I see a self-reinforcing virtuous circle in action. Enhancements in monetary and financial statistics make it possible to keep track of financial innovation, thereby facilitating an enhanced monetary analysis and thus ensuring an effective policy decision-making process. The enhanced monetary analysis and its use in the policy-making process, in turn, identify necessary improvements to the statistics, thereby closing the circle. Nevertheless, there is no reason to be complacent. Important innovations in the financial sector will continue to occur. We thus need to invest in flexible tools and methods so as to further adapt our statistics and analysis to changes both in the financial sector and in its interaction with the real economy. In this respect, a better international standardisation in the reporting and registration of individual financial products, transactions and financial institutions will be crucial. The ECB is closely involved in discussions at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).  Worldwide convergence and standardisation will allow a swift and flexible adaptation of monetary and financial statistics to financial innovation without creating an unnecessary reporting burden. We need to express data requirements in a more business-friendly way and we should be open to automation (e.g. based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or supervisory reports). Another potential for improvement lies in the re-use of micro-data, such as credit registers, for statistical purposes. The processes initiated within the framework of the G20 initiatives on data gaps might also provide an adequate forum for the very important and complex work ahead of us. Thank you very much for your attention. Now, Aurel Schubert, the ECB’s Director General Statistics, will present more details on the four datasets and stand ready to answer your questions.

       " {'ECB': [\"  Completing Economic and Monetary Union   Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the Gala Dinner of the State of the European Union conference “Revitalising the European Dream: A Corporate View”, Brussels, 28 June 2011 Ladies and gentlemen,  Thank you for inviting me to this conference. The theme to which it is dedicated is especially relevant today, when we have to draw all the lessons from the worst financial crisis since World War II.  These days, “Europe” and the benefits it brings have come to be taken for granted. Thanks to the success of European integration, the threat of war has become a memory of the past for many Europeans, in particular the younger generation.  This makes it all the more urgent to develop a renewed vision of the kind of Europe we want and indeed need – a vision that is easily understood and shared amongst EU citizens.  Each generation needs to affirm its commitment to Europe.  As Pierre Werner once observed, “it is necessary that even those born well after the 1950s and 1960s realise that the European Union has not come about by chance, but that it is based on the fundamental necessities of life amongst the peoples of Europe” [1]. Thankfully, these “fundamental necessities of life” – especially in the economic sphere – still seem to be felt and understood by the people in Europe. When asked, in the Eurobarometer surveys, which issues the European institutions should focus on in the coming years, Europeans believe that priority should be given to economic and monetary policy (37% in the EU and 41% in the euro area).  More than three out of four Europeans (78%) agree that measures to reduce the public deficit and debt in their country cannot be delayed.  More than three quarters of respondents (77%) consider that stronger coordination of economic and financial policies, as well as closer supervision of financial institutions would be effective in combating the crisis. The idea of initiating reforms to benefit future generations attracts equally strong support.   Revitalising Europe Revitalising Europe means bringing the reality of today’s Europe, of its institutions and policies, closer to these wishes and concerns of the EU citizens.  A Europe of stability and responsibility where the burdens of today’s adjustments are not shifted onto future generations.  An open and flexible Europe fostering education, entrepreneurship and innovation, with ample employment opportunities and a high standard of living.  A Europe that fully brings its economic and political weight to bear in an ever more globalised economy.  There is a good basis for all of this - we can indeed take pride in our past achievements. Having served as a member of the Governing Council of the ECB since the launch of the euro and as its President for almost eight years now, let me say that we have accomplished a lot: For example, companies in the euro area do not have to worry about price stability - I will come back later on this issue - and possible devaluations in the countries of their main trading partners. They face lower transaction and hedging costs. There is more price transparency and more ample access to finance, in general.  Since the start of the euro, employment in the euro area has risen by over 14 million, compared with about 8 million in the United States. Adjusted for population growth differences, growth per capita in the euro area has been almost the same as in the United States over the past decade, at about 1% per year in terms of GDP per capita growth.  Trade among euro area countries has also risen strongly. The value of exports and imports of goods within the euro area increased from about one quarter of GDP in 1998 to one third of GDP in 2007, with trade within euro area countries representing about a half of the total euro area trade.  Economic and Monetary Union The key to understanding the current challenges in the euro area is the specific construction of Economic and Monetary Union.  The coexistence of an achieved monetary union – the single currency, the single monetary policy and the Eurosystem with the ECB at its helm – and of a largely decentralised economic pillar.  Indeed, Member States are responsible for their fiscal and economic policies, but are called to treat them as a matter of common concern. Those policies are subject to a European governance framework to ensure that they are fully compatible with the requirements of a single currency.  Our governance framework largely relied on the self-discipline of national governments, with hard constraints at the EU level only in those few cases where hard rules were supposed to apply.  We had assumed that countries had sufficient incentives to ‘keep their house in order’ and thereby contribute to the common good of the euro area. An overly narrow interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity also shielded national economic policies from what was seen as undue European interference.  The experience of the first twelve years of EMU suggests that the limits of de facto soft policy coordination have largely been exhausted, with the interdependencies inside a monetary union calling for a stronger euro area dimension.  Let me now take a closer look at the two EMU pillars separately.  The ‘M’ of the EMU The ‘M’ of the EMU, or the monetary pillar, has performed well.  The ECB has a clear assignment: to deliver price stability, which is defined as an annual inflation rate below but close to 2% over the medium term. And over the 12 years since the launch of EMU, the average annual inflation rate in the euro area has been 1.97%. This is the best result of a major central bank in the euro area for any such period of 12 years, over the last 50 years. We achieved this during challenging times. Over the years, we have had to cope with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the aftermath of the events of 11September 2001, the jump in oil prices to $147 per barrel in 2008, rising prices of food and commodities, and then of course the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression. Yet throughout these very different economic shocks – which could have had either inflationary or deflationary consequences – citizens and market participants in the euro area have remained confident in our commitment. Inflation expectations have been firmly anchored in line with our definition of price stability.  The ‘E’ of the EMU It is the ‘E’ of the EMU, where progress is needed.  Already the 1989 Delors report stated that “an Economic and Monetary Union could only operate on the basis of mutually consistent and sound behaviour by governments and other economic agents in all member countries. (…) Uncoordinated and divergent national budgetary policies would undermine monetary stability and generate imbalances in the real and financial sectors of the community.”  What does this mean in practice?  It means improving economic governance. It means strengthening the rules to prevent unsound policies.  And it means to prohibit individual countries from pursuing policies that can harm themselves and the euro area as a whole.  For this reason, I have called, in the name of the Governing Council, on the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament to be very ambitious in reinforcing economic governance in the euro area.  We have called for a “quantum leap” in governance, for a substantially deepened economic union.   Essential reforms In the short-term, we have to tackle the most urgent issues by implementing the structural adjustment programmes that are currently underway.  The new economic governance framework that is currently being negotiated needs to be agreed and implemented in full and without delay.  We must get the institutional framework for the medium-term right.  The two EU co-legislators and the Commission have been negotiating the new economic governance package during the preceding weeks.  The European Parliament has confirmed its position at last Thursday’s plenary vote. The ECB particularly welcomes the strong message that is sent as regards the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact’s procedures have to be made more automatic. Our past experience in applying the Pact, especially after weakening of its core provisions in 2005, have amply demonstrated that a reform of these procedures has to be a sine qua non of a determined response to the current crisis. In this context, the Governing Council of the ECB regrets that the European Council did not decide to espouse the European Parliament’s views on this issue at the end of last week. This is an issue of key importance for the ECB. We consider that an essential progress in decision-making procedures in the Council is to make them more automatic.  The extension of reverse qualified majority voting to the preventive arm of the Pact, which the European Parliament rightly insists on, is not about a perceived loss of sovereignty. It is a mechanism that would allow all Member States to protect themselves better from the harmful effects of unsound fiscal policies.  Since the very beginning of the discussions on the reform of economic governance in May 2010, the ECB has asked for greater automatism in the decision-making procedures to limit the room for discretion. This is a major component of the ‘quantum leap’ that we have called for.  Had the Council had less room for manoeuvre in suspending or halting fiscal surveillance procedures in the years preceding the crisis, some of the euro area countries would not be facing as severe a sovereign debt crisis today.  However, this was not the entire story – surveillance instruments were lacking altogether as regards the build-up of competitiveness losses and of macroeconomic imbalances, which have made any solution to fiscal problems even more challenging.  Therefore, the ECB has also called for a fully-fledged surveillance procedure for competitiveness indicators and for macroeconomic imbalances. As a matter of fact, we have been pointing to the risks associated with competitiveness losses since 2005 and insisting on peer review and mutual oversight. The new procedure needs to be focused on the countries with large competitiveness losses and high indebtedness, since it is those countries that pose a potential threat to the functioning of EMU. In the short term, all parties have to take their responsibilities and agree on an ambitious governance package with two pillars – surveillance of fiscal policies and surveillance of macroeconomic policies, sending out a clear message to strengthen the economic policy framework that has been dented during the crisis. We urge a swift and ambitious completion of the legislative procedure to bring about certainty on this new framework. An additional element of stronger economic policy coordination for competitiveness and convergence surveillance in the euro area is the newly agreed Euro Plus Pact. The ECB supports the four goals of this Pact, namely to foster competitiveness and employment, to contribute to the sustainability of public finances and to reinforce financial stability. But we have also insisted that the Euro Plus Pact must be more than declarations. It must be followed up with concrete action. The ECB therefore welcomes the fact that the European Council last week called on the participating Member States to make their reform commitments more concrete, including specific timelines, to enable easier measurement of progress and benchmarking.   Single Market Furthermore, let us not forget that the euro area of the 17 countries is participating actively in the larger Single Market of the 27 member countries of the European Union. The Single Market forms an integral part of the wider Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The governance framework of this strategy underpins the wider surveillance efforts of the economic pillar of EMU. The first experience as part of the so-called European Semester is approaching its final stages, with the European Council’s endorsement of the proposed recommendations for individual Member States last week. The EU Single market offers a unique businesses environment with direct access to over 500 million potential business partners, employees and consumers with relatively high purchasing power. The Single Market has not been at the centre of the EU political priorities for quite some time and there have even been protectionist tendencies.  I, therefore, strongly support the initiatives aimed at re-launching the Single Market to address the prevailing structural challenges faced by the EU economy. The Single Market is at the core of the Union’s growth agenda. A widening and deepening of the Single Market should be viewed as an opportunity to raise the “speed limit” of the economy, which is highly warranted in the aftermath of the impact the financial crisis had on the European economy.  Moreover, completion of the Single Market is an essential ingredient of the required quantum leap towards a deeper economic union that is commensurate with the degree of economic integration and interdependency already achieved through monetary union. EMU has led to a strengthening of trade integration and competition within the Single Market by enhancing market access, reducing the costs of cross-border activities and increasing price transparency.  At the same time, a well-functioning Single Market is pivotal for the smooth functioning of EMU. It allows for swift and market-based adjustment in case of shocks and facilitates the correction of economic imbalances. A well functioning Single Market also requires proper design and implementation of financial sector policies. In this respect, the establishment of a new EU supervisory architecture to introduce genuine macro-prudential supervision and to strengthen the micro-prudential oversight at the EU level was a prerequisite for enhanced financial stability arrangements.  The establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board and the European Supervisory Authorities is an important milestone in providing the appropriate incentives to avoid excessive risk taking in the financial sector and to promote a level playing field in support of beneficial financial integration within the monetary union. Establishment of an EU framework for crisis management is an important complementary element of the new supervisory framework that still needs to be put in place.   Conclusion This is a large agenda already. What more would be needed for EMU in the longer term? I have sketched out in my speech in Aachen earlier this month some elements that in my view would warrant consideration in the design of a longer-term vision for Europe. Developing these elements in more detail would, however, be the topic of another speech. Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank you for your attention.

       "{'ECB': ['         When I last spoke at the Economic Club of New York a little more than a year ago, the financial crisis had just taken a much more virulent turn. In my remarks at that time, I described the extraordinary actions that policymakers around the globe were taking to address the crisis, and I expressed optimism that we had the tools necessary to stabilize the system.              Today, financial conditions are considerably better than they were then, but significant economic challenges remain. The flow of credit remains constrained, economic activity weak, and unemployment much too high. Future setbacks are possible. Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say that policymakers\\' forceful actions last fall, and others that followed, were instrumental in bringing our financial system and our economy back from the brink. The stabilization of financial markets and the gradual restoration of confidence are in turn helping to provide a necessary foundation for economic recovery. We are seeing early evidence of that recovery: Real gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States rose an estimated 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, following four consecutive quarters of decline. Most forecasters anticipate another moderate gain in the fourth quarter.              How the economy will evolve in 2010 and beyond is less certain. On the one hand, those who see further weakness or even a relapse into recession next year point out that some of the sources of the recent pickup--including a reduced pace of inventory liquidation and limited-time policies such as the \"cash for clunkers\" program--are likely to provide only temporary support to the economy. On the other hand, those who are more optimistic point to indications of more fundamental improvements, including strengthening consumer spending outside of autos, a nascent recovery in home construction, continued stabilization in financial conditions, and stronger growth abroad.              My own view is that the recent pickup reflects more than purely temporary factors and that continued growth next year is likely. However, some important headwinds--in particular, constrained bank lending and a weak job market--likely will prevent the expansion from being as robust as we would hope. I\\'ll discuss each of these problem areas in a bit more detail and then end with some further comments on the outlook for the economy and for policy.       Bank Lending and Credit Availability        I began today by alluding to the unprecedented financial panic that last fall brought a number of major financial institutions around the world to failure or the brink of failure. Policymakers in the United States and abroad deployed a number of tools to stem the panic. The Federal Reserve sharply increased its provision of short-term liquidity to financial institutions, the U.S. Treasury injected capital into banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) guaranteed bank liabilities. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury each took measures to stop a run on money market mutual funds that began when a leading fund was unable to pay off its investors at par value. Throughout the fall and early this year, a range of additional initiatives were required to stabilize major financial firms and markets, both here and abroad\\\\.           The ultimate purpose of financial stabilization, of course, was to restore the normal flow of credit, which had been severely disrupted. The Federal Reserve did its part by creating new lending programs to support the functioning of some key credit markets, such as the market for commercial paper--which is used to finance businesses\\' day-to-day operations--and the market for asset-backed securities--which helps sustain the flow of funding for auto loans, small-business loans, student loans, and many other forms of credit; and we continued to ensure that financial institutions had adequate access to liquidity. Additionally, we supported private credit markets and helped lower rates on mortgages and other loans through large-scale asset purchases, including purchases of debt and mortgage-backed securities issued or backed by government-sponsored enterprises.              Partly as the result of these and other policy actions, many parts of the financial system have improved substantially. Interbank and other short-term funding markets are functioning more normally; interest rate spreads on mortgages, corporate bonds, and other credit products have narrowed significantly; stock prices have rebounded; and some securitization markets have resumed operation. In particular, borrowers with access to public equity and bond markets, including most large firms, now generally are able to obtain credit without great difficulty. Other borrowers, such as state and local governments, have experienced improvement in their credit access as well.              However, access to credit remains strained for borrowers who are particularly dependent on banks, such as households and small businesses. Bank lending has contracted sharply this year, and the Federal Reserve\\'s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices shows that banks continue to tighten the terms on which they extend credit for most kinds of loans--although recently the pace of tightening has slowed somewhat. Partly as a result of these pressures, household debt has declined in recent quarters for the first time since 1951. For their part, many small businesses have seen their bank credit lines reduced or eliminated, or they have been able to obtain credit only on significantly more restrictive terms\\\\. The fraction of small businesses reporting difficulty in obtaining credit is near a record high, and many of these businesses expect credit conditions to tighten further.              To be sure, not all of the sharp reductions in bank lending this year reflect cutbacks in the availability of bank credit. The demand for credit also has fallen significantly: For example, households are spending less than they did last year on big-ticket durable goods typically purchased with credit, and businesses are reducing investment outlays and thus have less need to borrow. Because of weakened balance sheets, fewer potential borrowers are creditworthy, even if they are willing to take on more debt. Also, write-downs of bad debt show up on bank balance sheets as reductions in credit outstanding. Nevertheless, it appears that, since the outbreak of the financial crisis, banks have tightened lending standards by more than would have been predicted by the decline in economic activity alone.              Several factors help explain the reluctance of banks to lend, despite general improvement in financial conditions and increases in bank stock prices and earnings. First, bank funding markets were badly impaired for a time, and some banks have accordingly decided (or have been urged by regulators) to hold larger buffers of liquid assets than before. Second, with loan losses still high and difficult to predict in the current environment, and with further uncertainty attending how regulatory capital standards may change, banks are being especially conservative in taking on more risk. Third, many securitization markets remain impaired, reducing an important source of funding for bank loans. In addition, changes to accounting rules at the beginning of next year will require banks to move a large volume of securitized assets back onto their balance sheets. Unfortunately, reduced bank lending may well slow the recovery by damping consumer spending, especially on durable goods, and by restricting the ability of some firms to finance their operations.              The Federal Reserve has used its authority as a bank supervisor to help facilitate the flow of credit through the banking system. In November 2008, with the other banking agencies, we issued guidance to banks and bank examiners that emphasized the importance of continuing to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers, while maintaining appropriate prudence in lending decisions\\\\. This past spring, the Federal Reserve led the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP--a coordinated, comprehensive examination designed to ensure that 19 of the country\\'s largest banking organizations would remain well capitalized and able to lend to creditworthy borrowers even if economic conditions turned out to be worse than expected. The release of the assessment results in May increased investor confidence in the U.S. banking system. A week ago, the Federal Reserve announced that 9 of 10 firms that were determined to have required additional capital were able to fully meet their required capital buffers without any further capital from the U.S. Treasury, and that aggregate Tier 1 common equity at the 10 firms increased by more than $77 billion since the conclusion of the assessment\\\\.           The Federal Reserve will continue to work with banks to improve the access of creditworthy borrowers to the credit they need. Lending to creditworthy borrowers is good for the economy, but it also benefits banks by maintaining their profitable relationships with good customers. We continue to encourage banks to raise additional capital to support their lending. And we continue to facilitate securitization through our Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and to support home lending through our purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Normalizing the flow of bank credit to good borrowers will continue to be a top priority for policymakers.              While I am on the topic of bank lending, I would like to add a few words about commercial real estate (CRE). Demand for commercial property has dropped as the economy has weakened, leading to significant declines in property values, increased vacancy rates, and falling rents. These poor fundamentals have caused a sharp deterioration in the credit quality of CRE loans on banks\\' books and of the loans that back commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). Pressures may be particularly acute at smaller regional and community banks that entered the crisis with high concentrations of CRE loans. In response, banks have been reducing their exposure to these loans quite rapidly in recent months. Meanwhile, the market for securitizations backed by these loans remains all but closed. With nearly $500 billion of CRE loans scheduled to mature annually over the next few years, the performance of this sector depends critically on the ability of borrowers to refinance many of those loans. Especially if CMBS financing remains unavailable, banks will face the tough decision of whether to roll over maturing debt or to foreclose.              Recognizing the importance of this sector for the economic recovery, the Federal Reserve has extended the TALF programs for existing CMBS through March 2010 and newly structured CMBS through June. Moreover, the banking agencies recently encouraged banks to work with their creditworthy borrowers to restructure troubled CRE loans in a prudent manner, and reminded examiners that--absent other adverse factors--a loan should not be classified as impaired based solely on a decline in collateral value\\\\.    The Job Market        In addition to constrained bank lending, a second area of great concern is the job market. Since December 2007, the U.S. economy has lost, on net, about 8 million private-sector jobs, and the unemployment rate has risen from less than 5 percent to more than 10 percent\\\\. Both the decline in jobs and the increase in the unemployment rate have been more severe than in any other recession since World War II.7           Besides cutting jobs, many employers have reduced hours for the workers they have retained. For example, the number of part-time workers who report that they want a full-time job but cannot find one has more than doubled since the recession began, a much larger increase than in previous deep recessions. In addition, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers has fallen to 33 hours, the lowest level in the postwar period. These data suggest that the excess supply of labor is even greater than indicated by the unemployment rate alone.              With the job market so weak, businesses have been able to find or retain all the workers they need with minimal wage increases, or even with wage cuts. Indeed, standard measures of wages show significant slowing in wage gains over the past year. Together with the reduction in hours worked, slower wage growth has led to stagnation in labor income. Weak income growth, should it persist, will restrain household spending.              The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly. Declines in payroll employment over the past four months have averaged about 220,000 per month, compared with 560,000 per month over the first half of this year. The number of initial claims for unemployment insurance is well off its high of last spring, but claims still have not fallen to ranges consistent with rising employment.              Although economic pain is widespread across industries and regions, different groups of workers have been affected differently. For example, the unemployment rate for men between the ages of 25 and 54 has risen from less than 4 percent in late 2007 to 10.3 percent in October--nearly double the rise in unemployment among adult women. This discrepancy likely reflects the high concentration of job losses in manufacturing, construction, and financial services, industries in which men make up the majority of workers. From the perspective of America\\'s economic future, the effect of the recession on young workers is particularly worrisome: The unemployment rate among people between the ages of 16 and 24 has risen to 19 percent--and among African American youths, it is now about 30 percent. When young people are shut out of the job market, they lose valuable opportunities to gain work experience and on-the-job training, potentially reducing their future wages and employment opportunities\\\\.           Given this weakness in the labor market, a natural question is whether we might be in for a so-called jobless recovery, in which output is growing but employment fails to increase.              Productivity is defined as output per hour of work. Thus, essentially by definition, a jobless recovery--in which output is growing but hours of work are not--must be a period of productivity growth. In the jobless recoveries that followed the 1990-91 and 2001 recessions, productivity growth was quite strong. It may seem paradoxical that productivity growth--which in the longer term is the most important source of increases in real wages and living standards--can have adverse consequences for employment in the short term. But, when the demand for goods and services is growing slowly, that may be the case.              In fact, productivity growth has recently been quite high, even when the economy was contracting. Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have risen at about a 5-1/2 percent annual rate so far this year, well above longer-term averages. One reason for recent productivity gains likely was the reaction of employers to the freefall in the economy that began in the second half of 2008. Normally, employers are slow to cut their workforces when the economy turns down. The process of finding, hiring, and training new workers is costly. Thus, if employers expect the downturn will be neither too severe nor too lengthy, they retain more existing workers than they need in the short term, rather than laying them off and replacing them when the recovery begins. However, in the recent downturn, employers were exceptionally uncertain about the future, some even fearing a second Great Depression. Moreover, tight credit conditions left little margin for error. Accordingly, to protect themselves against the worst possibilities, employers shed workers much more sharply than usual in recessions. Thus, the productivity gains this year generally reflected pronounced declines in labor input rather than greater output.              Will the increases in productivity persist? It is likely that, in some cases, firms achieved their productivity gains by asking their remaining workers to provide extra effort. The additional gains that can be achieved in this way are limited and probably temporary. Although continuing uncertainty and financial constraints might make such firms hesitant to hire, if demand, production, and confidence pick up, they will find their labor forces stretched thin and will begin to add workers. However, other firms, facing difficult financial conditions and intense pressures to cut costs, seem to have found longer-lasting, efficiency-enhancing changes that allowed them to reduce their workforces; and some less-efficient firms, no longer able to compete, closed their doors. Again, improved efficiency confers great benefits in the longer term. However, to the extent that firms are able to find further cost-cutting measures as output expands, they may delay hiring.              Other factors will affect near-term employment growth as well. Business confidence in the durability of the expansion, for example, will help determine employers\\' willingness to hire. The current prevalence of part-time work and short workweeks may slow job creation early in the recovery period, as employers may prefer to convert workers from part-time to full-time status and to add overtime work before turning to new hires. In addition, difficulties in obtaining credit could hinder the expansion of small and medium-sized businesses and prevent the formation of new businesses. Because smaller businesses account for a significant portion of net employment gains during recoveries, limited credit could hinder job growth. Overall, a number of factors suggest that employment gains may be modest during the early stages of the expansion.       The Outlook for the Economy and Policy        I return now to the outlook for the economy and policy. As I noted, I expect moderate economic growth to continue next year. Final demand shows signs of strengthening, supported by the broad improvement in financial conditions. Additionally, the beneficial influence of the inventory cycle on production should continue for somewhat longer. Housing faces important problems, including continuing high foreclosure rates, but residential investment should become a small positive for growth next year rather than a significant drag, as has been the case for the past several years. Prospects for nonresidential construction are poor, however, given weak fundamentals and tight financing conditions.              In the business sector, manufacturing activity has been expanding and should be helped by the continuing strength of the recovery in the emerging market economies, especially in Asia. As the recovery takes hold, enhanced business confidence, together with the low cost of capital for firms with access to public capital markets, should lead to a pickup in business spending on equipment and software, which has already shown signs of stabilizing.              I have discussed two of the principal factors that may constrain the pace of the recovery, namely, restrictive bank lending and the weak job market. Banks\\' reluctance to lend will limit the ability of some businesses to expand and hire. I expect this situation to normalize gradually, as improving economic conditions strengthen bank balance sheets and reduce uncertainty; the fallout for banks from commercial real estate could slow that progress, however. Jobs are likely to remain scarce for some time, keeping households cautious about spending. As the recovery becomes established, however, payrolls should begin to grow again, at a pace that increases over time. Nevertheless, as net gains of roughly 100,000 jobs per month are needed just to absorb new entrants to the labor force, the unemployment rate likely will decline only slowly if economic growth remains moderate, as I expect.              The outlook for inflation is also subject to a number of crosscurrents. Many factors affect inflation, including slack in resource utilization, inflation expectations, exchange rates, and the prices of oil and other commodities. Although resource slack cannot be measured precisely, it certainly is high, and it is showing through to underlying wage and price trends. Longer-run inflation expectations are stable, having responded relatively little either to downward or upward pressures on inflation; expectations can be early warnings of actual inflation, however, and must be monitored carefully. Commodities prices have risen lately, likely reflecting the pickup in global economic activity, especially in resource-intensive emerging market economies, and the recent depreciation of the dollar. On net, notwithstanding significant crosscurrents, inflation seems likely to remain subdued for some time.              The foreign exchange value of the dollar has moved over a wide range during the past year or so. When financial stresses were most pronounced, a flight to the deepest and most liquid capital markets resulted in a marked increase in the dollar. More recently, as financial market functioning has improved and global economic activity has stabilized, these safe haven flows have abated, and the dollar has accordingly retraced its gains. The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor these developments closely. We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar and will continue to formulate policy to guard against risks to our dual mandate to foster both maximum employment and price stability. Our commitment to our dual objectives, together with the underlying strengths of the U.S. economy, will help ensure that the dollar is strong and a source of global financial stability.              The Federal Open Market Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. Of course, significant changes in economic conditions or the economic outlook would change the outlook for policy as well. We have a wide range of tools for removing monetary policy accommodation when the economic outlook requires us to do so, and we will calibrate the timing and pace of any future tightening to best foster maximum employment and price stability.

According to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, moderate fractions of banks continued to tighten standards and terms for loans to small firms, though the net fractions doing so generally continued to decline from the peaks last fall. The Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicates that spreads on small loans and loans extended by small banks (both proxies for loans to small firms) have increased significantly during the first three quarters of 2009.

Weak income growth, should it persist, will restrain household spending.              The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly. Declines in payroll employment over the past four months have averaged about 220,000 per month, compared with 560,000 per month over the first half of this year. The number of initial claims for unemployment insurance is well off its high of last spring, but claims still have not fallen to ranges consistent with rising employment.              Although economic pain is widespread across industries and regions, different groups of workers have been affected differently. For example, the unemployment rate for men between the ages of 25 and 54 has risen from less than 4 percent in late 2007 to 10.3 percent in October--nearly double the rise in unemployment among adult women. This discrepancy likely reflects the high concentration of job losses in manufacturing, construction, and financial services, industries in which men make up the majority of workers. From the perspective of America\\'s economic future, the effect of the recession on young workers is particularly worrisome: The unemployment rate among people between the ages of 16 and 24 has risen to 19 percent--and among African American youths, it is now about 30 percent. When young people are shut out of the job market, they lose valuable opportunities to gain work experience and on-the-job training, potentially reducing their future wages and employment opportunities\\\\.           Given this weakness in the labor market, a natural question is whether we might be in for a so-called jobless recovery, in which output is growing but employment fails to increase.              Productivity is defined as output per hour of work. Thus, essentially by definition, a jobless recovery--in which output is growing but hours of work are not--must be a period of productivity growth. In the jobless recoveries that followed the 1990-91 and 2001 recessions, productivity growth was quite strong. It may seem paradoxical that productivity growth--which in the longer term is the most important source of increases in real wages and living standards--can have adverse consequences for employment in the short term. But, when the demand for goods and services is growing slowly, that may be the case.              In fact, productivity growth has recently been quite high, even when the economy was contracting. Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have risen at about a 5-1/2 percent annual rate so far this year, well above longer-term averages. One reason for recent productivity gains likely was the reaction of employers to the freefall in the economy that began in the second half of 2008. Normally, employers are slow to cut their workforces when the economy turns down. The process of finding, hiring, and training new workers is costly. Thus, if employers expect the downturn will be neither too severe nor too lengthy, they retain more existing workers than they need in the short term, rather than laying them off and replacing them when the recovery begins. However, in the recent downturn, employers were exceptionally uncertain about the future, some even fearing a second Great Depression. Moreover, tight credit conditions left little margin for error. Accordingly, to protect themselves against the worst possibilities, employers shed workers much more sharply than usual in recessions. Thus, the productivity gains this year generally reflected pronounced declines in labor input rather than greater output.              Will the increases in productivity persist? It is likely that, in some cases, firms achieved their productivity gains by asking their remaining workers to provide extra effort. The additional gains that can be achieved in this way are limited and probably temporary. Although continuing uncertainty and financial constraints might make such firms hesitant to hire, if demand, production, and confidence pick up, they will find their labor forces stretched thin and will begin to add workers. However, other firms, facing difficult financial conditions and intense pressures to cut costs, seem to have found longer-lasting, efficiency-enhancing changes that allowed them to reduce their workforces; and some less-efficient firms, no longer able to compete, closed their doors. Again, improved efficiency confers great benefits in the longer term. However, to the extent that firms are able to find further cost-cutting measures as output expands, they may delay hiring.              Other factors will affect near-term employment growth as well. Business confidence in the durability of the expansion, for example, will help determine employers\\' willingness to hire. The current prevalence of part-time work and short workweeks may slow job creation early in the recovery period, as employers may prefer to convert workers from part-time to full-time status and to add overtime work before turning to new hires. In addition, difficulties in obtaining credit could hinder the expansion of small and medium-sized businesses and prevent the formation of new businesses. Because smaller businesses account for a significant portion of net employment gains during recoveries, limited credit could hinder job growth. Overall, a number of factors suggest that employment gains may be modest during the early stages of the expansion.       The Outlook for the Economy and Policy        I return now to the outlook for the economy and policy. As I noted, I expect moderate economic growth to continue next year. Final demand shows signs of strengthening, supported by the broad improvement in financial conditions. Additionally, the beneficial influence of the inventory cycle on production should continue for somewhat longer. Housing faces important problems, including continuing high foreclosure rates, but residential investment should become a small positive for growth next year rather than a significant drag, as has been the case for the past several years. Prospects for nonresidential construction are poor, however, given weak fundamentals and tight financing conditions.              In the business sector, manufacturing activity has been expanding and should be helped by the continuing strength of the recovery in the emerging market economies, especially in Asia. As the recovery takes hold, enhanced business confidence, together with the low cost of capital for firms with access to public capital markets, should lead to a pickup in business spending on equipment and software, which has already shown signs of stabilizing.              I have discussed two of the principal factors that may constrain the pace of the recovery, namely, restrictive bank lending and the weak job market. Banks\\' reluctance to lend will limit the ability of some businesses to expand and hire. I expect this situation to normalize gradually, as improving economic conditions strengthen bank balance sheets and reduce uncertainty; the fallout for banks from commercial real estate could slow that progress, however. Jobs are likely to remain scarce for some time, keeping households cautious about spending. As the recovery becomes established, however, payrolls should begin to grow again, at a pace that increases over time. Nevertheless, as net gains of roughly 100,000 jobs per month are needed just to absorb new entrants to the labor force, the unemployment rate likely will decline only slowly if econ'],\n",
       " 'FED': ['  A case for rapid euro adoption?   Introduction for panel discussion, by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, OeNB Conference on European Economic Integration, on ‘The Euro’s Contribution to Economic Stability in CESEE’, Vienna, 16 November 2009 Ladies and gentlemen, [1]  It is a pleasure to be at this conference among such distinguished panellists to speak about the European economic integration and the adoption of the euro. For us at the ECB, the topic of the optimal timing of euro adoption for the EU countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) that have not yet done so is very important. According to the Maastricht Treaty, all EU countries are called upon adopting the euro at some stage. So it’s not a question of if, but rather on when to join.  However, to ensure that the monetary union is working smoothly, it is essential – and the Maastricht Treaty has foreseen this - that the countries joining the euro area have achieved a sufficient degree of sustainable convergence. This is first of all in the interest of the country concerned. Moreover, sustainable convergence is a cornerstone of the European Monetary Union on which the success story of the euro is built. Since its introduction back in 1999, the euro has become one of the major currencies of the world. The low inflation environment in the euro area can be largely attributed to the well anchored inflation expectations and the high credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy to ensure price stability over the medium-term. During the global financial crisis, it became apparent that the euro has been an important shelter for the euro area countries to protect them against what otherwise may have resulted in an exchange rate and balance of payments crisis. This led to the widespread perception that the euro area is a safe haven.  Let me in the following speak about the economic situation in the CEE countries and their prospect on joining the euro.       The CEE countries have been strongly hit by the financial crisis    Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the CEE countries have been strongly hit by the global financial crisis, although at varying degrees across countries [ slide 1]. Due to the slump in global activity, heightened risk aversion by international investors and a de-leveraging by financial institutions, most CEE countries have seen a significant weakening of export demand and a substantial worsening of their external financing conditions [ slide 2]. It seems that financing difficulties have been particularly severe in those countries that had accumulated large imbalances during pre-crisis times and whose debt structure was characterised by significant currency and maturity mismatches. In some countries balance sheet effects associated with large exchange rate depreciations posed a risk to financial stability. The financial crisis reversed some of the impressive progress that the CEE countries had already made in terms of convergence. In the years preceding the crisis most CEE countries were growing rapidly. However, excessive credit growth, substantial wage increases and house price bubbles, contributed to the overheating of some of the economies. This in turn led to a widening of the positive output gap and a non-sustainable deterioration of the current account position [ slide 3] and [ slide 4]. Moreover, the overheating pressures in some countries translated into rising inflation and led to a real appreciation of their currencies, which in turn aggravated the external imbalances further.  To dampen the impact of the crisis, national authorities have adopted a number of policy measures, which however differed significantly across countries, depending on the room for manoeuvre to adopt supportive monetary and fiscal policies in the various countries.       Substantial EU and ECB support to weather the crisis    Also the international and European community provided substantial financial support to some countries in the region. The EU supported some CEE countries via the medium-term financial assistance (MTFA) facility, in conjunction with the IMF programmes. This MTFA facility was substantially increased during the crisis and also the EU structural funds have helped to cushion the impact of the crisis. Let me also emphasize the support from the ECB, contributing to the stabilisation of financial markets in the region. Many banks in the CEE countries are owned by euro area banks. Therefore, the CEE countries benefited strongly from the ECB’s enhanced credit support policy and the unlimited provision of liquidity to euro area banks. On top of this, the ECB has offered some of the national central banks repo lines to meet euro liquidity needs. Overall, we can say that European authorities and institutions have supported the CEE countries to weather the crisis.      Need to return to a sustainable convergence process     The financial crisis has clearly shown how important it is generally for any country in the EU to embark on policies aimed at sustainable growth paths. This includes sound economic policies, enhanced economic flexibility and the building-up of fiscal buffers in normal times. Also the regulatory framework for financial markets has to be adjusted at the national and supranational level such as to ensure economic and financial stability.  The need for such policies and the need for pursuing a regulatory reform agenda, certainly applies to all EU countries, not just the CEE countries. That said, there have been some proposals that a rapid euro adoption could help the CEE countries to overcome the impact of the crisis more quickly. On this, let me stress that policies to overcome the financial crisis and the adoption of the euro are two distinct issues that need to be clearly separated.  On the one hand, policies to overcome the crisis - such as large fiscal measures - were clearly needed and have been put in place in all EU countries. Now that the worst of the financial crisis seems to be over, we have to return to sustainable policies and must advance with the regulatory reform agenda as spelled out by the G20. On the other hand, the financial crisis has not changed anything with respect to the procedure governing the euro adoption process. Before joining the euro area, countries need to ensure that the right accompanying policies are implemented and that the structure of their economies ensures a high shock absorption capacity. In particular, the economies need to be sufficiently flexible to cope with the more limited range of economic policy instruments once they enter the euro area. While the CEE countries have already made good progress in this respect before the crisis, further efforts are needed. The financial crisis has hit the CEE countries in a severe way and, therefore, required a forceful policy response. Once the crisis is over, a return to sustainable policies is absolutely essential for the further convergence process. A sufficient degree of sustainable convergence is crucial for the CEE countries, to be able to reap the full benefits of euro area membership. Otherwise, the single monetary policy of the euro area might not be suitable, thereby bearing the risk of boom-bust cycles and high inflation volatility in the country concerned.  All this underlines the importance of a credible euro adoption strategy. I should emphasize that entering the euro area prematurely, - that is before reaching a sufficient degree of convergence and economic flexibility - would not be a panacea for the CEE countries to overcome the crisis impact. On the contrary, a premature entry into the euro area would deprive the countries from important adjustment tools and would therefore not be in the interest of the country joining.       A credible euro adoption strategy is important    A credible euro adoption strategy helps stabilising the economies, as it provides an important anchor for policymakers. As already mentioned before, a credible strategy requires in particular responsible macroeconomic policies and advancements in structural reforms.  One essential element of the countries’ euro adoption strategies relates to the credibility of timetables. At the time of EU accession most countries had announced to join the euro area as soon as possible. We all know that this was based on assumptions at the time of the accession. The recent financial crisis has impacted the convergence progress and has moved the euro adoption further into the future. Therefore, individual countries’ timetables have to be carefully looked at and adjustments may be necessary.  Let me emphasise that an overly ambitious timetable for adopting the euro can be rather costly for the country concerned. This may encourage market participants to pursue strategies which may prove to be risky if the timetable turns out not to be achievable. We observed this in some CEE countries, which for example allowed the emergence of unsustainable credit growth and a large share of loans denominated in euro.      A look beyond the EU borders    The financial crisis also took its toll outside EU borders. Many non-EU emerging European economies, including EU candidate and potential candidate countries, recorded a strong fall in external and domestic demand, amid mounting concerns over financial stability and increased uncertainty about the availability of external financing. While policymakers in these countries currently focus rather on the entry into the EU and not on euro adoption, the need for sustainable convergence is still high on their agenda. Overall, non-EU emerging European economies are in the early stages of catching-up in income levels with those of the EU. Ensuring a smooth process of real and nominal convergence is therefore a key priority in the region. Moreover, the risks of boom-bust cycles in credit or asset prices have been amply illustrated by the recent developments, whereby countries with sounder fundamentals were generally less affected by the crisis. Rapid and determined international policy actions, including support from European institutions via Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) and Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) funds have contributed to bringing confidence back. [ slide 5] Moreover, I have to mention an issue of relevance for some economies in the region, namely the official, unilateral use of the euro. As you all know, unilateral euroisation is not in line with the provisions of the Treaty. And as the recent intensive financial pressures experienced by the unilaterally euroised economies (in particular Montenegro) have also illustrated, the unilateral adoption of the euro is not the magic tool that automatically provides protection against the impact of external shocks.      Concluding remarks    Let me conclude my remarks. The CEE countries have already made significant progress with respect to their catching-up with the euro area. However, some of the countries have been severely hit by the financial crisis. This clearly has an impact on the state of the convergence process of the CEE countries and has potentially moved euro adoption further into the future. The timetables of the euro adoption have to be carefully assessed, given particularly the large uncertainties that are associated with the current economic and financial situation. One thing, however, needs to be very clear. The financial crisis has not changed our policy for adopting the euro. Therefore, to prematurely adopt the euro, in particular if not accompanied by a sufficient degree of sustainable convergence, is certainly not a solution to overcome the impact of the crisis. Only a credible euro adoption strategy helps stabilising the economies, also with respect to the crisis impact. Achieving sustainable convergence can be seen as an important anchor and an opportunity for the CEE countries to adopt economic policies that will eventually lead to the successful adoption of the euro, hopefully not in the too distant future.
